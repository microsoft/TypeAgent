# Mobile sample

This sample illustrates how to host the [TypeAgent](/) shell on Android.  It replaces the speech reco with Android OS speech services and calls the [API package](/packages/api/) to host the shell in a browser instance. This sample also shows how to implement agent callbacks on the local device to do things such as place phone calls, send SMS, do local search, and more.
