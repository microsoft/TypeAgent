TypeAgent is a TypeScript library for building personal agents with natural language interfaces. It uses [TypeChat](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat) to create application agents that take actions based on user input.

## What is TypeAgent?

TypeAgent provides a framework for:

- Building personal agents with natural language interfaces
- Creating application agents that take actions
- Defining actions using TypeChat schemas

This architecture allows you to create agents that can understand natural language requests and translate them into concrete actions within your application.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understand and respond to natural language commands
- **TypeScript Integration**: Fully typed API for better development experience
- **Schema-Based Validation**: Define expected inputs and outputs with TypeScript schemas
- **Multiple Agent Support**: Create and coordinate multiple specialized agents

TypeAgent includes several example agents:

- **List Agent**: A simple agent for managing lists
- **Calendar Agent**: An agent for managing calendar events
- **Email Agent**: An agent for composing and sending emails
