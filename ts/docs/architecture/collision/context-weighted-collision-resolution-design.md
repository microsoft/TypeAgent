## 1. Problem & motivation

When two or more agents can handle the same input, the dispatcher detects a
**collision** and picks a winner. Every existing resolution strategy — the policy for
_picking_ a winner, a separate axis from the detection _points_ where collisions are noticed
(§4) — is _context-free_:

| Strategy             | What decides the winner                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `first-match`        | Heuristic match order (effectively arbitrary).                    |
| `score-rank`         | Grammar match shape (`matchedCount`/`nonOptionalCount`/wildcard). |
| `priority`           | A **static** `priorityOrder` string or registration order.        |
| `user-clarify`       | Ask the user every time.                                          |
| `preference-clarify` | A learned per-pair preference (after consent), else ask.          |

None use **what the conversation is currently about**. If the user has spent ten
turns in spreadsheets, `add a row` colliding between `excel.addRow` and
`list.addItems` should resolve to **excel** — without a clarify card, without an
LLM call, and without a brittle _global_ priority list that would wrongly pin
excel over list for every user forever.

`priority` is the closest existing tool but it is **global and static**. We want
a **dynamic, conversation-local priority** that shifts with the topic, is cheap
enough to run on every collision, deterministic (explainable, testable), and that
**abstains** when the signal is weak rather than guessing.

### Idea in one line

Give each agent a set of keywords, derive a keyword profile of the recent
conversation, and at collision time pick the candidate whose keywords are closest
to what the conversation is about — deferring to the existing tiers whenever the
topical signal is weak or ambiguous.

---

## 2. Goals & non-goals

### Goals

- **G1.** A new resolution behavior, `contextSelector` (strategy value
  `context-weight`), ranking colliding candidates by topical proximity to the
  recent conversation.
- **G2.** On the **grammar/cache path**, a confident deterministic
  decision keeps the request on the cache path and **avoids the downstream LLM
  translation**. On the **embedding/llmSelect path** there is **no LLM saved**
  — the benefit there is a _deterministic, explainable
  tiebreak_ of the embedding cluster, not latency/cost.
- **G3.** Deterministic in the hot path. Same conversation state ⇒ same decision.
- **G4.** **Abstains safely.** Weak/ambiguous/under-covered ⇒ no change; fall
  through to the existing tiers.
- **G5.** Off by default, per-point opt-in, fully observable via existing
  telemetry — matching the subsystem's soft-rollout posture.
- **G6.** No _required_ LLM, and none on the hot path. Production _prefers_ a one-off LLM
  distillation for quality, with a deterministic, drift-proof lexical floor as the guaranteed
  fallback — so an LLM is never required and never called during collision resolution.

### Non-goals

- Not replacing `user-clarify`/`priority`/learned preferences. It runs as an
  earlier tier and, on abstain, hands the same candidate set to them unchanged.
- Not an embedding/NLU re-architecture. Core matching is lexical. Embedding
  soft-match is an optional, flagged enhancement only.
- Not a durable per-user profile. The conversation profile is session-scoped.

## 3. Architecture (end to end)

The full system in one view — keyword production (frozen before runtime) on the left,
the per-turn context vector in the middle, and the collision-time decision on the right:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  A. KEYWORDS — produced before runtime, two sources                (§5–§6)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

                                                                                    │
   ── Source 2: sidecar overrides (optional, layered, configurable) ──              │

                                                           (add / remove / replace) │
                                                                                    ▼
                                        keyword index:  schema.action → { keywords }

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  B. CONTEXT VECTOR — runtime, once per user turn                  (§7–§8, §12)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   each user request ──► ring buffer (last N=20, canonicalized tokens)
                              │
                              └──► decay each turn by λ^age (λ=0.9) ──► context vector
                                                                        { token → weight }

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  C. RESOLVE — at a Stage-1 grammar collision                      (§4, §9–§11)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

                  └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                                 ▼
              D-4 scorer:  Σ  decayed-frequency × candidate-local-IDF        (§9)
                                 ▼
              E-2 decision:  coverage · history-only · evidence gate · margin (§10)
                       ┌─────────┴──────────┐
                  confident              abstain
                       │                    │
              resolve the winning     fall through, unchanged, to the
              Stage-1 match           configured grammar strategy
              (no LLM) + U-2          (first-match / priority / user-clarify)
              affordance              — never worse than today
```

**Reading it:** A produces a keyword vector per `(schema, action)` from two sources — an
always-present _keyword file_ (extracted from the schema) plus an optional _sidecar_ of layered
overrides; B maintains a live, decayed keyword-frequency map of the conversation; at a
collision, C scores each colliding candidate's keyword vector against that map and either resolves
(deterministically, no LLM) or abstains to today's behavior. The only LLM in the whole picture
is the _one-off_ distillation that produces the keyword vectors at onboarding/backfill (with
deterministic lexical extraction as the fallback floor) — the runtime hot path that reads them
is LLM-free and deterministic.

---

## 4. How it fits the existing code

A user request runs through a **two-stage pipeline**, where the second stage runs
**only if the first produces no match**. They are sequential fallback, not parallel
— the linchpin is literally `match ?? translateRequest(...)`
(`interpretRequest.ts:110-122`):

```
USER REQUEST
   │
   ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STAGE 1 — Grammar / cache match     (matchRequest.ts)        │  deterministic · NO LLM
│   construction cache + agent grammars validate the input    │
│   ≥2 agents match → collision → resolveGrammarCollision()   │
└───────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                │  HIT → return typed action ───────────────▶ DONE  (Stage 2 never runs)
                │  miss
                ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STAGE 2 — Translate                 (translateRequest.ts)    │  cache-miss only
│   a) pickInitialSchema: embedding search picks a schema      │  · no LLM
│        near-tie cluster → applyLlmSelectStrategy() resolves   │
│   b) translateRequestWithSchema: LLM fills the typed action  │  ← the LLM call
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Quick summary of each stage

- **Stage 1 — grammar/cache (`matchRequest`).** Deterministic, no model call. Matches
  the input against the construction cache and agent grammars. When ≥2 agents validate
  the same input it is a **collision**, resolved today by `resolveGrammarCollision`
  (strategies: first-match / score-rank / priority / user-clarify / preference-clarify),
  plus the independent registry-first detector. A match returns a complete typed action
  (from a learned cache entry **or** a compiled grammar rule — no LLM either way).
- **Stage 2 — translate (`translateRequest`), runs only on a Stage-1 miss.** Two
  sub-steps: (a) `pickInitialSchema` uses an **embedding** similarity search to choose
  _which_ schema to translate against — and if the top candidates are a near-tie (the
  **`llmSelect`** collision point) it breaks the tie with `applyLlmSelectStrategy`,
  which makes **no model call**; (b) `translateRequestWithSchema` makes the **actual
  LLM call** to produce the typed action, regardless of which schema (a) chose.

> The name **`llmSelect`** refers to the selection step that _feeds_ the LLM
> translator — the selection itself uses **embeddings**, not an LLM.

### Where `contextSelector` fits

contextSelector is a tiebreaker for an **already-detected** collision: Stage 1 has
produced several competing `MatchResult`s (each a complete typed action, from the
learned cache _or_ a compiled grammar rule), and contextSelector **selects the winner
among them** — it never synthesizes an action. So it slots into **Stage 1**: confident
→ return the winning match (no LLM); abstain → fall through to today's strategy (and
ultimately to Stage 2). This is the **only** insertion that can avoid the LLM, because
a Stage-1 match short-circuits Stage 2. Inserting at the Stage-2
`llmSelect` tie would only change _which_ schema is translated — the LLM still runs, so
there is no cost saving (out of scope for v1; see §11).

**Inputs handed to the selector at resolution time.** contextSelector is a pure scorer
over two data inputs — it holds no conversational state of its own:

1. the **competing candidates** and their **keyword vectors** (per `(schema, action)`;
   see §5–§6); and
2. the **context vector** — a running keyword-frequency map derived from the ongoing
   conversation (e.g. `{ spreadsheet:8, formula:5, cell:4, … }`; see §7–§8). This is a
   session-scoped property _passed in_ at collision time — built from a contextSelector-owned
   ring buffer of recent user requests (§7), **not** derived from `ChatHistory` (which is empty
   in agent-server mode) and **not** computed inside the scorer.

```
each user turn ──▶  context vector  { spreadsheet:8, formula:5, … }   (the data)
                          │
  Stage-1 collision ──────┤  candidates + keyword vectors  +  context vector
                          ▼
                   contextSelector (scorer, §9)  ──▶  resolve winner / abstain
```

The split matters: the **context vector is the data**, contextSelector is the
**scorer**. Keeping conversational state out of the scorer is what makes it
deterministic and unit-testable (§12), and it is the line that the §7–§8 decisions
(what feeds the vector, and whether it is maintained running vs recomputed on demand)
operate on.

### Scope across the four detection points

The dispatcher detects collisions at four points (see `dispatcher.md` §"Detection points").
These are a _separate axis_ from the resolution **strategies** in §1 — strategies decide
_how_ to pick a winner; detection points decide _where_ a collision is noticed.
contextSelector is a new resolution behavior that targets exactly **one** of them:

| Detection point                                                                | Active today?                                | contextSelector's relationship                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`static`** (duplicate `actionName` across schemas, at registration)          | registration-time integrity check            | **N/A** — fires before any conversation exists, so topical context cannot apply.                                                     |
| **`grammarMatch`** (≥2 validated grammar/cache matches for one input, Stage 1) | active runtime                               | **Targeted** — the single v1 insertion (resolve or abstain here).                                                                    |
| **`llmSelect`** (top-N embedding scores within `scoreDeltaThreshold`, Stage 2) | active runtime                               | **Deferred** — saves no LLM there (the embedding pick is already model-free and translation runs regardless); out of v1 scope (§13). |
| **`fuzzy`** (meaning-overlap across differing names/grammars)                  | inert (scaffolded; default scorer returns 0) | **N/A** — never fires today.                                                                                                         |

So the only _active runtime routing_ points are `grammarMatch` and `llmSelect`;
contextSelector covers the first and defers the second. `static` is a build-time check and
`fuzzy` is dormant, so neither is in scope.

### Existing infrastructure we reuse

- **Registry-first tiers** (`matchRequest.ts`, `matchCollision.ts`,
  `collisionResolution.ts`) run _ahead of_ any strategy, always, independent of `detect`, when
  `preference.registryFirst` is on and a neighborhood registry is loaded. On a registry-flagged
  ambiguity they walk a resolution ladder: **Tier-0** (a pending one-shot pick from a resolved
  clarify card), **Tier-1** (a learned/explicit preference), **Tier-1.5** (`contextSelector` over
  the registry-expanded neighborhood — the cache-masking fix, §13.3), then **Tier-2** (a registry
  clarify). Tiers 0 and 1 run _ahead of_ `contextSelector`, so it never overrides an explicit user
  choice; on the ordinary grammar path (no registry hit) `contextSelector` still runs directly on
  the ≥2 validated matches.
- **`resolvePreferenceClarify`** (`collisionResolution.ts`) is the shared resolution
  policy both stages already call for `preference-clarify` — the natural host if we
  later want both-stage coverage from a single change.
- **The learned-preference store** (`collisionPreferences.ts`, consulted via
  `resolvePreferenceClarify`) is the existing **consented-choice** mechanism. A possible
  reuse, deferred to §11: when the user confirms a topical pick, **bootstrap a learned
  preference** so the existing path auto-resolves it next time (U-3). This store is
  **separate from the live context vector** — the vector stays a full keyword map and is
  never collapsed into a single topic tag; whether/how a confirmed pick is persisted is a
  §11 concern, not part of the scoring data.
- **`neighborhoods.json`** (`session.ts:295-306`, `collisionResolution.ts:30-39`) is the
  runtime-loaded collision-_detection_ registry. It is **not** where keyword overrides live
  (those are a separate `collision-keywords.json` sidecar, §5) — but its recorded misroute
  phrases are a deterministic **source** for the misroute sidecar layer (§6.2).

---

## 5. Part A — Where keyword data lives

> **✅ DECIDED: keyword data lives in exactly two places — an auto-derived per-action
> keyword file, plus an optional hand-tuning sidecar.**
>
> 1. **Derived defaults (the keyword file).** Every `(schema, action)` gets a keyword vector
>    auto-derived from the schema (how it's produced is §6). This is the baseline —
>    nothing is hand-authored, and it tracks the live schema automatically.
> 2. **Override sidecar (`collision-keywords.json`).** A small, separate file that can
>    **add / remove / replace** keywords for the handful of actions that actually collide.
>    It stores only deltas over the derived defaults and hot-reloads as data — no rebuild
>    or re-ship.
>
> Keywords are keyed **per individual action** (matching the `(schema, action)` collision
> identity), not per whole agent — so two schemas of one multi-domain agent can't end up
> with identical vectors. (Indices: _A-2_ = per-action granularity; _A-3_ = the sidecar.)
> Rejected alternatives — whole-agent-level keywords, or per-user profile state — are in §15.

**Why this split.** Two forces pull in different directions. _Correctness_ pulls
toward per-action granularity: the keyword identity must match the `(schema, action)`
collision identity, or two schemas of one multi-domain agent get identical vectors and
permanently abstain — which is exactly what the **derived per-action defaults** provide.
_Evolvability_ pulls toward a runtime override: the colliding few must be tunable without
re-shipping an agent — which is what the **sidecar** provides. And because the defaults are
derived rather than hand-authored (§6), the "home" question largely dissolves — there is
nothing to store except optional overrides.

### 5.1 How the sidecar works (mechanism)

The override file is its **own** sidecar — a `collision-keywords.json`, **not**
`neighborhoods.json` (which keeps its separate collision-detection role). It
works the same way that registry does _mechanically_ — a plain JSON artifact on disk,
separate from any agent's code, loaded at runtime — keyed by `(schema, action)` and storing
only **deltas** over the derived defaults:

```jsonc
// collision-keywords.json (sidecar; only the colliding few need entries)
{
  "excel.addRow": { "add": ["spreadsheet", "formula"], "remove": ["office"] },
  "list.addItems": { "add": ["grocery"] },
}
```

**Effective keyword vector** for a `(schema, action)`:

```
effective = derived(schema.action)  ∪  override.add  −  override.remove
            (or, with the replace escape hatch: override.replace verbatim)
```

So the user is **adding** discriminative keywords on top of the auto-derived list,
not restating it — which keeps the file tiny and prevents the wholesale drift that
a fully hand-authored list would invite (the derived layer keeps tracking the live
schema automatically).

### 5.2 Why it is "hot-reloadable" (data, not code)

The reload mechanism is the one the registry already uses
(`ensureCollisionRegistry`, `collisionResolution.ts:30-39`):

```ts
const path = ctx.session.getConfig()....registryPath;
if (path !== ctx.collisionRegistryPath) {                 // path changed?
    ctx.collisionRegistry = CollisionRegistry.load(path); // fresh fs read
    ctx.collisionRegistryPath = path;
}
```

`CollisionRegistry.load` does a fresh `fs.readFileSync` and **never throws** — a
missing/malformed file degrades to empty (`collisionRegistry.ts:63-85`). The
consequences:

- **Hot = data, not code.** Editing the sidecar (or its path) takes effect with **no
  dispatcher rebuild and no agent re-ship**. Contrast a manifest list (A-1/A-2),
  which is baked into the in-memory schema at agent registration; editing it
  requires a rebuild **and** a shell restart (README:438-441). This is the entire
  reason A-3 is paired with A-2: the colliding handful can be corrected operationally
  and take effect immediately.
- **Caveat (honest):** as written, the registry re-reads only when the configured
  **path string changes** — it is not a file-watcher. After editing the file in
  place, the user re-points the path, or we add a small `@config … reload` /
  re-set-path trigger. Cheap to add; called out so "hot-reload" is not oversold.

### 5.3 The tuning flow in practice

Tuning is **telemetry-driven** — someone tunes because they saw a wrong routing:

1. **Notice it** — e.g. `add a row` routed to `list` instead of `excel`; visible in
   `@collision events` (the ring buffer records candidates + chosen).
2. **Pick a lever** (two exist, different blast radius):
   - **One-off, no keyword editing:** record a _learned preference_ — "for this exact
     candidate set, pick excel." Already ships (`@collision preferences set …`,
     README:423-426); lowest friction.
   - **Generalizable:** add a _discriminative_ keyword so the topic signal routes
     correctly going forward — the sidecar.

A command surface that mirrors the existing `@collision preferences` verbs
(set/remove/clear/list) keeps it familiar:

```
@collision keywords excel.addRow add spreadsheet formula
@collision keywords excel.addRow remove office
@collision keywords excel.addRow list     # shows derived + overrides, merged
@collision keywords excel.addRow clear     # revert to derived-only
```

Two ergonomics notes that connect to later parts:

- Because **Part D** leans toward _flattened/capped_ positional weights, the user
  **does not have to fuss about keyword order** when adding.
- Because **Part D** uses _candidate-local discriminativeness_, adding a keyword the
  _other_ colliding candidate also has won't help (it cancels). The `list` view can
  surface which added keywords are actually discriminative, guiding the user toward
  effective edits.

## 6. Part B — How keyword vectors are produced

> **✅ DECIDED: keyword vectors are produced two ways — **standard onboarding extraction**
> (automatic, runs for every action) and **ad-hoc tuning** (optional, refines only the
> actions that actually collide).**
>
> ```
> keyword vector =  standard extraction  (automatic — every action, at onboarding)
>                +  ad-hoc tuning         (optional — only actions that collide)
> ```
>
> 1. **Standard extraction (the default producer).** When an action first appears — at one of
>    **three moments**: a step in the **onboarding flow** (new agents), a one-time **backfill**
>    (already-shipped agents), or **dynamic generation** (agents/actions created at runtime, e.g.
>    flow creation) — a keyword vector is produced for it, with **no authoring required**.
>    **LLM distillation is the preferred producer**: a one-off, higher-quality pass we expect to
>    beat raw lexical output (it adds synonyms the schema never says, normalizes phrasing).
>    **Lexical extraction is the deterministic fallback floor** — it guarantees a vector for
>    _every_ action even when no LLM ran (dynamic runtime agents where a synchronous model call
>    is undesirable, agents not yet distilled, or LLM-less environments) and underpins the §10
>    full-coverage guard. We don't avoid LLM calls on principle; we only keep them from becoming a
>    **hard runtime dependency or repeated requirement** — and a one-off distillation is neither.
> 2. **Ad-hoc tuning (optional refinement).** For the handful of actions that actually collide,
>    the vector can be sharpened by three optional, independently-toggleable layers: **user
>    tuning** (manual keyword edits), **misroute tuning** (deltas mined from real misroute
>    phrases in `neighborhoods.json`), and **user preferences** (deltas derived from learned
>    routing preferences).
>
> Each action's **baseline vector is produced once** by standard extraction (at its onboarding /
> backfill / dynamic-generation moment) and is not recomputed thereafter; ad-hoc tuning is layered
> on afterward as additional, **lightweight** refinements. Extraction itself may use an LLM where
> quality matters — the offline distillation pass, and optionally when generating keyword vectors for
> dynamically-added actions — so it is **not** strictly LLM-free. What _is_ guaranteed
> deterministic and LLM-free is the **collision-time scoring path that reads these vectors (§9)**.
> (_Where_ the produced vectors are stored — the always-present keyword file vs. the tuning
> sidecar — is §5; this section is only about how they are produced, and no action-schema field is
> added either way.) The rejected alternative — generating keywords from embedding clusters — is
> in §15.

### 6.1 Standard extraction (every action, at onboarding)

This is the default producer. **LLM distillation is preferred** (a one-off, higher-quality pass
run at onboarding/backfill); **lexical extraction is the deterministic floor** that guarantees a
vector whenever no LLM ran. Either way it runs as a step in the **onboarding flow** (and the
equivalent backfill / dynamic-generation moments), so every action gets a vector with no
authoring.

**LLM distillation (the preferred producer).** A one-off LLM pass — run at onboarding and the
backfill, or at generation time for a dynamically-added action — produces higher-quality
keywords _and synonyms the schema never says_ (`sheet`→`spreadsheet`), normalizes phrasing, and
is committed/stored alongside the agent. We expect it to beat raw lexical output, so it is the
default where a model is available. Accepted costs: **drift** (stored artifacts go stale) —
mitigated later by an **automated refresh pipeline** in the spirit of the doc-autogen pipelines.
It runs **once** per action and is never on the collision-time hot path, so it adds no runtime
LLM dependency.

**Lexical extraction (the deterministic fallback floor).** A deterministic extractor mines each
agent's own schema text — manifest + schema `description`, de-camelCased action names
(`addItems`→"add items"), parameter names + their JSDoc comments, optionally `.agr` grammar
literals — minus stopwords and generic CRUD verbs. It is **drift-proof** (recomputed from the
live schema) and covers **every agent including runtime/dynamic ones** (`allowDynamicAgents`),
so it guarantees a vector — and thus the §10 full-coverage guard — even when distillation hasn't
run (not-yet-distilled agents, dynamic agents where a synchronous model call is undesirable, or
LLM-less environments). Lower quality (identifier-ish); it cannot invent synonyms the schema
never mentions, which is exactly why distillation is preferred when available.

**Three lifecycle moments — a vector always ends up existing:**

| Moment                 | Applies to                                             | What runs                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Onboarding flow**    | a newly-onboarded agent                                | LLM distillation (preferred), lexical fallback — as a step in the onboarding flow **(implemented)** |
| **Initial backfill**   | agents that shipped before this feature                | a one-time LLM-distillation pass over the existing roster (lexical fallback)                        |
| **Dynamic generation** | agents/actions created at runtime (e.g. flow creation) | lexical extraction at load — optionally LLM-distilled if a model is available; no build step (§6.3) |

The **onboarding moment** is implemented: the Onboarding Agent's scaffolder phase
generates a committed `<schema>.keywords.json` beside each schema source it writes.
See [onboarding-keyword-generation-design.md](./onboarding-keyword-generation-design.md)
for the design and the shared `agent-dispatcher/contextSelector`
`generateKeywordFileForSchemaSource` helper it (and future moments) reuse.

The extractor is classic IR, no model call:

```
1. tokenize + canonicalize (NFKC, lowercase, strip punctuation)
2. drop stopwords + generic CRUD verbs (add/get/update/remove/show/…)
3. count term frequency across the corpus
4. emit the top-N as the keyword vector
```

### 6.2 Ad-hoc tuning (only the colliding few)

Tuning refines the extracted vector for the handful of actions that actually collide. Its
overrides can be sourced from three layers, merged in a configurable priority; each is optional
and independently toggleable:

- **User tuning (manual).** Explicit add / remove / replace edits a human makes after seeing a
  misroute (the `@collision keywords …` flow, §5.3). Highest intent clarity, lowest volume.
- **Misroute tuning (auto-derived from real phrases).** `neighborhoods.json` records, per
  known-confusable cluster, the _real user phrases_ that misrouted between its members. A
  deterministic extractor mines those into discriminative keyword deltas — concentrated on
  exactly the hard, colliding pairs. It covers only clusters already in the registry, so it is
  a boost, never the base.
- **User preferences (learned).** Learned routing preferences (`@collision preferences`) can
  contribute deltas that bias a colliding set toward the user's observed choice — expressed as
  keyword weight rather than a hard pin.

Because the misroute and preference layers are auto-derived, the merge is **configurable**: a
deployment can run manual-only, manual + misroute, or all three.

**Misroute tuning shares the keyword-file extractor — still no LLM.** The misroute layer reuses
the same deterministic extractor as the keyword file, differing only in the input corpus
(misroute phrases instead of schema text). For a colliding pair it adds a distinctive-terms
step — rank a term by how much more it appears in this member's phrases than the sibling's
(TF-difference / log-odds-ratio) — so shared/ambiguous tokens cancel and discriminating tokens
rise.

> The misroute phrases in `neighborhoods.json` were themselves LLM-generated in the offline
> corpus run that built the registry — but that is committed _source data_, like a
> human-written schema description. The extraction on top is mechanical, and **runtime is
> never involved**.

**Worked example — misroute mining on a real cluster.** From the shipped registry, the cluster
`calendar.findTodaysEvents` ↔ `taskflow.dailyAgendaEmail` records 9 phrases the user _intended_
for `taskflow.dailyAgendaEmail` but that misrouted to `calendar.findTodaysEvents`:

> "Email me today's agenda." · "Could you send me an email with my schedule for today?" ·
> "Shoot me today's calendar events." · "Send me an email with today's calendar events."

Extraction for `taskflow.dailyAgendaEmail`:

- raw tokens → `email, agenda, schedule, send, inbox, calendar, events, today`
- distinctive-terms vs the `calendar` sibling: `today`, `calendar`, `events` appear for _both_
  intents (they are _why_ the two collide) → cancel; `email`, `agenda`, `send`, `inbox` are
  unique to the email intent → rise
- emitted keyword deltas → **`email, agenda, send, inbox`**

At runtime, if the conversation has been about email (context map `{ email:6, send:3, inbox:2 }`)
and the user says _"get me today's agenda"_ — colliding the two actions — those mined keywords
overlap the conversation for `taskflow` and not for `calendar`, so contextSelector resolves to
`taskflow.dailyAgendaEmail`. The phrases became override keywords; the keywords feed the normal
scorer (§9).

### 6.3 When extraction runs (performance)

This concerns the **lexical fallback floor** — the deterministic path. (LLM distillation, the
preferred producer, is a one-off onboarding/backfill cost that never touches boot or the
collision-time hot path.)

The lexical extractor is pure string processing — no model, no I/O beyond text already parsed at
agent registration. At real scale (~30 agents, ~10k tokens total) it is low-single-digit
milliseconds — rounding error next to grammar NFA compilation and embedding-model load already
on the boot path. A concrete sketch:

```ts
function extractKeywords(schema): string[] {
  const text = [
    schema.manifestDescription,
    schema.schemaDescription,
    ...schema.actions.map((a) => deCamel(a.name)), // "addItems" → "add items"
    ...schema.actions.flatMap((a) => a.params.map((p) => deCamel(p.name))),
    ...schema.actions.flatMap((a) => a.params.map((p) => p.jsdoc ?? "")),
  ].join(" ");
  const counts = new Map<string, number>();
  for (const tok of tokenize(text)) {
    // lowercase, strip punct, split
    const t = stem(tok); // optional light Porter stemmer
    if (STOPWORDS.has(t) || GENERIC_VERBS.has(t)) continue;
    counts.set(t, (counts.get(t) ?? 0) + 1);
  }
  return [...counts]
    .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])
    .slice(0, TOP_N)
    .map(([t]) => t);
}
```

**Recommendation:** to keep even that off the boot path, **precompute at build time** for
shipped agents (emit `<agent>.keywords.json` into `dist/`, mirroring the `.ag.json` / `.pas.json`
pipeline — zero boot cost), with a **content-hash cache / lazy extraction** for dynamically-added
agents that have no build step. The only real cost risk is a heavy NLP dependency; a tiny
rule-based stemmer (or skipping stemming in v1, leaning on the §12 canonicalizer) avoids it.

### Reasoning & context

This section decides **where the context vector's data comes from**. The natural raw material is
the user's own recent messages — but two facts make it non-trivial, both **decisive because our
target is agent-server mode** (the connected mode the CLI always uses):

1. The dispatcher's conversation stores (`ChatHistory`, knowPro memory) are populated only when
   knowledge-extraction is on, and agent-server turns it _off_ for cost — so the data we'd reach
   for first **isn't there in our target mode** (§7.1).
2. The correct long-term source — knowPro's extracted topics/entities, owned by the
   conversation-memory system of record — isn't usable for v1 yet: it's LLM-produced
   (non-deterministic) and currently unpopulated in agent-server mode (§7.3).

Hence the **source seam**: ship a deterministic, always-available source now (simple, good for
benchmarking) behind a clean upgrade path to knowPro — without the scorer caring which is behind it.

### 7.1 Why not source from `ChatHistory` (the agent-server finding)

The obvious source — the dispatcher's `ChatHistory` — does **not** work in agent-server
mode (the connected mode the CLI always uses). Verified line-by-line:

| Data in agent-server mode                                       | Present?           | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ChatHistory` **user entries** (the user's words)               | ❌ No              | `addRequestToMemory` is gated by `requestKnowledgeExtraction`, which agent-server sets `false` (`server.ts:179-182`; gate at `requestCommandHandler.ts:469`). The user turn is never written to `ChatHistory`.                                                   |
| `ChatHistory` **assistant entries + entities** (action results) | ✅ Yes             | `addActionResultToMemory` runs because its gate is `actionResultEntityStorage \|\| actionResultKnowledgeExtraction`, and `actionResultEntityStorage` **defaults `true`** and isn't overridden (`actionHandlers.ts:532-535`, `commandHandlerContext.ts:710-712`). |
| knowPro `conversationMemory` (structured topics/entities)       | ❌ No              | its `queueAddMessage` calls are gated by the knowledge-extraction flags, both `false` in agent-server (`memory.ts:137`; user side gated entirely).                                                                                                               |
| Raw `request` string                                            | ✅ Yes (transient) | passed to `matchRequest` every turn, **ungated** by anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

So in agent-server mode the **user's own words are recoverable only from the live
`request`** — not from any store. A `ChatHistory`-sourced context vector would simply be
empty there. (The flag is a cost/perf choice, not an internet check; the dispatcher's
"no internet" comment on it is misleading.)

> Correction to an earlier note in this doc: the **assistant-side entities do survive**
> agent-server mode — but they describe _system outputs_ (a resolved workbook, a found
> event), not the user's phrasing, so they're a secondary signal at best.

### 7.2 V1 — raw-token map

contextSelector owns a small **ring buffer of the last N raw user-request strings**,
appended at an ungated point (it already receives `request` in `matchRequest`). At
collision time the buffer is tokenized + canonicalized (the §12 pipeline, shared with
keyword extraction) into the context-vector frequency map.

- **Signal:** user-message tokens only (the original **C-1**) — cleanest topic signal, no
  feedback loop, no extraction-flag coupling.
- **Deferred:** **C-3** agent-of-record (recent winners) — real signal but a
  self-reinforcing feedback loop (lock-in); needs caps + same-pair exclusion before it's
  safe. Revisit behind local benchmark data.
- Because contextSelector owns the buffer (rather than deriving it from `ChatHistory`), it
  needs a few **invalidation hooks** (`@history clear`, session switch) — a small, bounded
  cost. This settles the §8 source-of-truth question: the map is **contextSelector-owned**,
  not recomputed from `ChatHistory` (which is empty in agent-server mode anyway), leaving
  §8 to decide only the _windowing / decay_ shape.
- **The context vector is per-request and candidate-independent — compute it once, memoize
  it.** It depends only on the conversation, not on _which_ candidates are colliding, so it
  should be built once per request and cached on the request context. v1 scores against it
  exactly once (the single grammar-stage insertion, §11). This memoization also future-proofs
  the deferred F-3 both-path coverage: if contextSelector ever also runs at the embedding
  stage, it must **reuse the same vector** (re-scoring only against the different candidate
  set), never rebuild it — recomputing would be wasteful and could drift the determinism
  contract (§12).

### 7.3 V2 — knowPro extracted topics + entities (the intended source)

knowPro is the conversation-memory system of record, so reading the signal from it — rather
than a contextSelector-owned buffer — is the architecturally correct end state. It already
defines exactly the shape we want (`knowledgeSchema.ts:25-66`):

```ts
type ConcreteEntity = {
  name: string;
  type: string[];
  facets?: { name; value }[];
};
type KnowledgeResponse = {
  entities: ConcreteEntity[];
  actions;
  inverseActions;
  topics: string[]; // "Detailed, descriptive topics and keyword"
};
```

- **`topics: string[]`** is already a distilled keyword list — the same shape as our agent
  keyword vectors — and entity `type[]` / `name` are keyword-like. A context vector built
  from these would be richer, pre-canonicalized, and sourced from the system that properly owns
  conversation history.
- **Why V1 ships first anyway:** knowPro knowledge is **LLM-extracted per message**, so it is
  (a) **non-deterministic** and (b) only exists when extraction runs — which agent-server
  disables today for cost. Extraction is _async / queued_, so _reading_ already-extracted topics
  is not a hot-path LLM call — but the data must first be populated. So V1's contextSelector-owned
  buffer is the pragmatic starting point for simplicity and benchmarking; the swap to knowPro
  happens once that extraction is available in agent-server mode.

So V1 is not so much "thrown away" as a **deterministic stepping stone**: it validates the
scorer and yields the first benchmarks, then V2 takes over the signal from knowPro — the system
that rightly owns conversation history — behind the same seam.

## 8. Part C(ii) — Conversation frequency model

> **✅ DECIDED: recent turns count more than older ones — each turn's influence fades
> smoothly as the conversation moves on, so the signal tracks topic shifts instead of
> lingering on stale topics.** We keep roughly the last 20 turns and weight each by how long

> `decay (λ) = 0.9` and `windowTurns (N) = 20` — are config knobs so they can be retuned from
> local benchmarks without code changes.

### Reasoning & context

Part C(i) (§7.2) already settled the **source** — a contextSelector-owned ring buffer of raw
requests (the only user-words signal available in agent-server mode; `ChatHistory` is empty
there). So the original **C-4** ("recompute on demand from `ChatHistory`") is **moot** and
the only open question here is the **recency model** over that buffer: how to weight older
turns vs. newer ones.

**Why decay (not a uniform window).** Uniform-last-`N` is just decay with `λ=1` — every turn
counts equally, with a hard cutoff at the window edge. Decay (`λ<1`) instead fades older
turns smoothly, which is what lets a **topic shift** flip the winner: after the user moves
from spreadsheets to calendar, the stale spreadsheet turns lose weight and calendar takes
over within a few turns instead of lingering until they age out of the window.

**Why `λ = 0.9`, `N = 20`.** Two intuitive readings of `λ` pin the choice:

| λ       | half-life `ln0.5/lnλ` | effective window `1/(1-λ)` | turns to flip after an 8-turn topic | feel             |
| ------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 0.8     | ~3 turns              | 5                          | ~3                                  | snappy / jittery |
| **0.9** | **~6.6 turns**        | **10**                     | **~5**                              | gentle, stable   |
| 0.95    | ~13.5 turns           | 20                         | ~8                                  | sluggish         |

- `λ = 0.9` → ~6–7-turn half-life and ~10-turn effective window: recent enough to track a
  genuine topic change in a handful of turns, stable enough not to whipsaw on one stray
  message. (The "turns to flip" column is the geometric-sum crossover where a new topic
  outweighs a prior 8-turn topic: `(1−λ^m) > λ^m·(1−λ^8)`.)
- `N = 20` hard cap ≈ 2× the effective window, so the buffer keeps everything still carrying
  meaningful weight (`0.9^20 ≈ 0.12`) and discards the truly stale tail — `N` and `λ` stay
  consistent rather than fighting.
- Avoid `λ ≤ 0.8` (one off-topic message can swing routing) and `λ = 1.0` (no decay, the
  case we rejected).

**Implementation notes.**

- The owned buffer needs a few **invalidation hooks** (`@history clear`, session switch;
  §7.2) — the bounded cost of holding state instead of deriving it.
- If top-K pruning of the map is ever added, **prune by _effective_ (post-decay) weight**,
  not raw counts — otherwise a stale-but-frequent token can crowd out a fresh decisive one.
- Defer cross-session warm carryover entirely (reproducibility).

> only two approaches on the roadmap.** The scorer ranks each candidate by how much the recent
> conversation overlaps its keywords, counting most the words that uniquely point to one

>    also evaluate **semantic** matching (embedding cosine between the conversation's
>    topics/entities and each candidate's keyword vector) to bridge vocabulary gaps TF-IDF's
>    exact-token overlap can't (e.g. `"spreadsheet editing"` ↔ `excel`). This is the one case
>    that genuinely departs from TF-IDF, and it stays a flagged enhancement (§2 non-goal).
>
> Explicitly **not** on the roadmap: plain cosine, plain dot-product (no IDF), BM25, and
> log-odds/Naive-Bayes. They were evaluated and set aside (below); the forward path is
> TF-IDF → embeddings, not these. (Index: _D-4_ = the chosen TF-IDF overlap.)

```
score(a) = Σ_{ token ∈ C ∩ K_a }  C[token] × disc(token)

  C[token]    = decay-weighted conversational frequency (§8)             — "how much talked about"
  K_a         = candidate a's keyword vector (flattened; order ignored)  — §6
  disc(token) = candidate-local IDF over the colliding set:              — "how distinguishing"
                  token in keywords of all colliding candidates → ~0  (cancels, like "the")
                  token unique to one candidate                 → high (distinguishes)
```

In words: **the sum of the decay-weighted conversational salience of the tokens that
distinguish this candidate.** Fully deterministic and printable — you can show exactly which
tokens fired and why.

### Reasoning & context

The scorer consumes the two §4 inputs: the context vector `C` (decay-weighted frequency map,
§8) and each candidate's keyword vector `K_a` (§6). Two sub-decisions shape it:

**Candidate-local, not global, IDF.** Global IDF (documents = all ~30 agents) is noisy and
non-local — installing an unrelated agent that also lists "item" would shift `idf("item")` and
perturb _excel-vs-list_ routing. Candidate-local IDF (documents = just the 2–3 colliding
candidates) asks only "does this token distinguish _these_ candidates?": shared tokens cancel
(`~0`), unique tokens score high. Computed fresh per collision, immune to unrelated agents, cheap.

**Flattened keyword sets (order ignored).** `disc` and `C[token]` already encode which keywords
matter; position is a noisier third proxy, and the ranks come from crude counts or LLM ordering.
So `posWeight = 1` always (the list is a **set**), with all weighting from `C × disc`. Capped
positional weighting is parked as a tuning lever if benchmarks show rank-0 keywords are
under-counted.

### The scoring roadmap — TF-IDF now, embeddings later

D-4 (TF-IDF) ships and stays unchanged as the signal source moves from raw tokens to knowPro
entities (the source seam, §7). The one forward step that adds genuinely new power is
**embedding similarity** — matching on _meaning_ rather than exact tokens, to bridge gaps like
`"spreadsheet editing"` ↔ `excel` that lexical overlap can't:

```
simple context vectors ─► D-4 TF-IDF ─► knowPro entities ─► D-4 TF-IDF ─► embedding similarity (evaluated)
   (§7 V1 source)         (now)          (§7 V2 source)      (same scorer)   (semantic match, flagged)
```

The other lexical formulas (cosine, dot-product, BM25, log-odds) were evaluated and set aside —
they lose information D-4 keeps or add untunable machinery that buys little on tiny, uniform
keyword lists (per-option rationale in §15). The forward path is TF-IDF → embeddings, not these.

## 10. Part E — Decision rule (resolve vs. abstain)

> **✅ DECIDED: resolve only when the winner is both clearly on-topic and clearly ahead of
> the runner-up — otherwise abstain and let today's behavior take over.** Concretely,
> contextSelector picks a winner only when (1) two mandatory safety guards pass, (2) the
> winner matches _enough_ topical signal (the "evidence gate"), and (3) it beats the
> runner-up by a margin. Fail any of these and it **abstains**, passing the candidates
> through unchanged. The bias is deliberately toward abstaining — a wrong silent reroute is
> worse than a missed opportunity.

### How it works, in plain language

A collision arrives; the scorer (§9) gives each candidate a number. Before trusting the top
score, contextSelector runs four checks, in order. **All four must pass to resolve;** failing
any one means abstain.

1. **Coverage check** — _do all the colliding candidates even have keywords?_ If any
   candidate's keyword vector is empty, abstain. (Otherwise an agent with keywords would beat an
   agent without them just for being covered — not because the conversation favored it.)
2. **History-only** — _score from what was said before this request._ The current message
   itself is excluded, so contextSelector reflects the _conversation_, not the words in the
   request being routed.
3. **Enough-signal check (the evidence gate)** — _is the winner actually on-topic?_ The
   winner must match at least a couple of the candidate's distinct keywords (`minUniqueTokens`,
   default 2), and those matches must carry enough total weight (`minMass`). One stale mention
   isn't enough.
4. **Clear-winner check (the margin)** — _is the winner clearly ahead?_ The top score must
   beat the runner-up by a margin. If two candidates are both on-topic, that's genuine
   ambiguity → abstain and let the user/priority decide.

### Worked examples

Running collision: user says _"add a row"_ → `excel.addRow` vs `list.addItems`.
(excel keywords ⊃ {spreadsheet, formula, cell, row, column}; list keywords ⊃ {item, grocery,
shopping}.)

Notice every resolve/abstain is **explainable from counts** — e.g. "resolved to excel:
matched {spreadsheet, formula, cell} (3 ≥ 2), mass 17, runner-up 0." That readability is
exactly what the local benchmark output needs to calibrate the thresholds.

### Why this rule

The evidence gate is what makes a _count-based_ score safe to threshold — it asks "enough
signal?" and "clear winner?" in units you can read, instead of an opaque similarity number.
Because D-4's candidate-local IDF cancels shared tokens, the runner-up often scores ~0, so an
**absolute** margin is clean and avoids the divide-by-zero a relative ratio would hit.

**Thresholds to calibrate (on fixtures, biased toward abstention):** `minUniqueTokens`
(start 2), `minMass`, and `margin`. A missed opportunity is cheaper than a wrong silent
reroute, so tune conservative.

## 11. Part F — Integration & UX

> **✅ DECIDED.**
>
> - **Where it runs:** only on the fast grammar/cache path (Stage 1) — the one place a
>   confident pick actually avoids an LLM call. Collisions on the slower embedding path keep
>   today's behavior. (Index: _F-2_, inside `resolveGrammarCollision`.)
> - **When it abstains:** by default it hands the collision to today's strategy
>   (`first-match` / `priority` / `user-clarify`) at no extra cost; an opt-in mode can instead
>   escalate the request to the LLM. Configurable, default = hand off to today's strategy.
> - **What the user sees:** when the feature is on, a small non-blocking note —
>   _"↪ routed to Excel — recent topic · change"_ — so a topical reroute is never invisible
>   (nothing is shown while the feature is off). A fully-silent mode is opt-in only; a
>   "confirm once, then remember" variant is documented as a future enhancement.

### 11.1 Where to insert (F)

**Why the grammar/cache path only (F-2).** contextSelector behaves like a deterministic
fast-path there: **confident → pick the winning Stage-1 match (no LLM); abstain → get out of
the way and let the request proceed to the LLM path.** This is the **only** place it avoids an
LLM, it's one insertion, and it matches the natural request flow (§4). Inserting at the
embedding/`llmSelect` tie is a _different, lower-value_ feature — a deterministic tiebreak when
we're already committed to the LLM, with **no cost saving** — so it is out of v1 scope.
Extending `resolvePreferenceClarify` (F-3) is worth it _only_ if we later want both-path
coverage plus consent/learning reuse from a single change. (Full option table in §15.)

#### Abstain semantics (what the fallback is)

On the grammar path Stage 1 _already_ produced a match, so "abstain" picks between two
fallbacks: **defer to the configured strategy** (`first-match`/`priority`/`user-clarify`) —
stays on the cache path, preserves today's behavior exactly, zero added cost — or
**escalate to the LLM path** (re-translate) — conceptually clean ("deterministic shortcut, else
LLM") but forces an LLM call on every low-confidence collision. **Default: defer-to-strategy**,
with `escalate-to-llm` as an opt-in. Either way, abstain never makes the decision worse than
today — it only chooses _which_ existing fallback runs.

### 11.2 UX — what the user sees when it resolves

When enabled, contextSelector shows a small non-blocking note on a reroute — **U-2**:
_"↪ routed to Excel — recent topic · change"_ — cheap, transparent, keeps the LLM-avoidance
win, and one-tap correctable. A pure-silent reroute (U-1) is opt-in only (it would be the
product's first zero-consent invisible reroute). A "first-time confirm → write a learned
preference → silent thereafter" variant (U-3) is documented as a future enhancement that
bootstraps Tier-1 preferences (pairs with F-3 if taken later).

### 11.3 Config surface (Part H)

The config type is kept lean (the existing `llmSelect` block has 4 fields). Only `detect`
is exposed via `@config` (per the existing convention); the rest are `data.json` hand-edits:

```ts
contextSelector: {
  detect: boolean; // off by default
  windowTurns: number; // ring-buffer look-back (N, default 20)
  decay: number; // per-turn recency decay (λ, default 0.9)
  minUniqueTokens: number; // evidence gate (default 2)
  minMass: number; // evidence gate (default tuned on fixtures)
  margin: number; // discriminative margin / ratio
  abstainFallback: "defer-to-strategy" | "escalate-to-llm"; // default "defer-to-strategy"
}
```

**Defer to follow-ups (don't ship the knobs):** weighting scheme + `gamma`, global
idf vs candidate-local toggle, `softMatch` embeddings, `warmCarryover`,
`useEntities`, `useAgentOfRecord`, sub-schema granularity switches.

### 11.4 Cache-masked collisions — the registry-first `contextSelector` tier

> **✅ IMPLEMENTED (opt-in).** Closes the §13.3 cache-masking gap when a neighborhood registry
> is loaded and `preference.registryFirst` is on.

**The problem.** The construction cache short-circuits the grammar store on any hit, and a
learned/built-in construction lives in a **single** agent's namespace. So once the cache has
committed an ambiguous phrase, `AgentCache.match` returns exactly **one** validated `MatchResult`.
`isCollision` needs ≥2 distinct `(schema, action)` tuples, so the ordinary grammar-path
`contextSelector` sees no collision and the cached answer wins outright — topic never weighs in.
This is why live demos have to run `@const builtin off`.

**The fix — reuse registry-first as the detector, `contextSelector` as the resolver.** The
neighborhood registry (`neighborhoods.json`) already records which actions are empirically
confusable. `resolveGrammarRegistryFirst` (`matchCollision.ts`) uses it as a standalone ambiguity
detector: `detectRegistryAmbiguity` flags even a single cache match as known-ambiguous and
re-expands it into the matched action **plus its registry siblings**. Those siblings are just
`(schema, action)` tuples — they have **no** cache `MatchResult` — but the keyword index
(`ctx.contextSelectorKeywords.effective`) derives a vector for **any** action from its schema, so
the match-agnostic TF-IDF scorer can weigh the whole neighborhood regardless of what the cache
matched. The registry-first resolution ladder becomes:

```
registry flags the (single) cache match as known-ambiguous
   │
   ├─ Tier 0  one-shot pick (a resolved clarify card)        → honor (explicit choice)
   ├─ Tier 1  learned / explicit preference                  → honor (explicit choice)
   ├─ Tier 1.5  contextSelector over {match + siblings}      → resolve on a clear recent topic:
   │              winner has a cache MatchResult  → return it            (no LLM)
   │              winner is a registry sibling    → request-scoped topical route + fallthrough
   │                                                (translation pins the schema + note; §pickInitialSchema)
   │              abstain / skip                  → fall through to Tier 2
   └─ Tier 2  registry clarify (sibling-enriched options)    → ask the user
```

Tiers 0 and 1 run **ahead of** `contextSelector`, so it never overrides an explicit user choice
(the §4 guarantee still holds); Tier 1.5 only pre-empts the Tier-2 clarify, replacing a prompt with
an automatic topical route when the conversation makes the intent obvious. On abstain the honest
fallback is the registry's own clarify (the registry asserted genuine ambiguity and there's no
recent-topic evidence), so `abstainFallback` (a grammar-path concern) is intentionally **not**
consulted here.

**Routing a sibling winner (and keeping the affordance honest).** When the topical winner is a
sibling the cache never produced, there is no `MatchResult` to return. The tier records a
**request-scoped** `pendingTopicalRoute` (`{ schemaName, note }` on the command context) and returns
`{ kind: "fallthrough" }`, so `matchRequest` bails out of the grammar path. The _same request's_ LLM
translation (`pickInitialSchema`) reads-and-clears that route, pins the schema **before** embedding
selection (so it holds even when embedding-based selection is off), and surfaces the U-2 note only
**then** — at the point the route is actually committed. A cache-match winner instead returns
`{ kind: "match", … }` and its note is shown in `matchRequest` (also a committed point, resolved with
no LLM). Two properties fall out of this: the affordance never claims a route that isn't taken (the
note is emitted at the commit site, not preemptively), and the hint can't leak into a later turn (it
is request-scoped and read-and-cleared, unlike the durable cross-turn `collisionOneShotPicks` used
for explicit clarify-card / preference picks).

**Scoring the right set (two correctness bounds).** Because the tier _routes_ automatically
(no clarify card to reject a bad option), the scored candidate set is bounded on both sides:

- **Only executable routes.** Registry siblings are filtered to the turn's **active-schema set**
  (the same set the cache matched against, passed from `matchRequest`) before scoring — a sibling
  for a disabled or out-of-activity agent is dropped, so it can never win a route and then be
  rejected downstream. The validated cache matches are always active by construction.
- **No dropped cache match.** The scored set is the **union** of the flagged neighborhood members
  and _every_ validated cache match. `detectRegistryAmbiguity` only re-expands one neighborhood, so
  on a genuine multi-match collision (validated has ≥2 tuples, one registry-flagged) a validated
  candidate outside that neighborhood would otherwise be dropped; unioning keeps it in contention,
  and the de-dup keeps the match-carrying representative so a matched member still routes with no
  LLM.

**Accepted behavior — registry-first can steer a genuine multi-match toward a sibling.** The union
above is deliberately _permissive_: on a genuine multi-match collision, it also puts the flagged
member's registry siblings (which the cache did **not** match for this phrase) into contention beside
the real cache candidates. Two consequences are **accepted by design**, not treated as bugs:

- A speculative sibling can **win** the topical score and be routed (via the request-scoped route +
  LLM translation), even though the cache/grammar didn't match it.
- Because TF-IDF is candidate-local, adding those siblings perturbs the IDF/gate math, so enabling
  `registryFirst` can change a multi-match decision relative to validated-only scoring — even on a
  collision that was never cache-masked.

The rationale: **the construction cache is not authoritative.** It is a learned/compiled artifact
that can commit to the wrong neighbor, so the design intentionally lets a strong conversational
signal _override_ it and push toward the topically-correct sibling — that override is the whole point
of the feature. This is safe because the correction is bounded by the same guards that make the
tier trustworthy elsewhere: the evidence gates (`minUniqueTokens` / `minMass` / `margin`) are
absolute and abstain-biased, so **adding contenders makes a confident resolve _harder_, not looser**
— extra candidates split the field and bias toward abstain → the Tier-2 clarify (the safe "ask"
direction), never toward a looser trigger; the active-schema filter guarantees any winner is
actually executable; and the decision stays deterministic (§12). The residual risk — a speculative
sibling out-scoring two real matches on a strong, focused topic — is the accepted cost of allowing
context to correct a mis-committed cache entry. An operator who wants the stricter "only ever route
to what the cache matched" behavior can leave `registryFirst` off (the default), which confines
`contextSelector` to validated-only scoring.

**Gating.** Wholly opt-in and layered on existing switches — it activates only when
`preference.registryFirst` is on, a registry is loaded (`preference.registryPath`), the registry
actually flags the phrase, and `contextSelector.detect` is on. In the stock config
(`registryFirst: false`, empty `registryPath`) the tier is inert and behavior is byte-for-byte
today's. See §13.3 for the residual default-config gap and the cheaper cache-side root fix.

## 12. Part G — Determinism hardening

Determinism (G3) is the whole reason this design exists instead of an LLM tiebreaker, so
each item below closes a specific way the _same_ conversation state could otherwise produce a
_different_ routing decision. This is a requirements checklist, not an either/or choice.

**Scoring & comparison**

- **Total ordering everywhere:** tie-break by canonical token string, then stable
  `schemaName`, then `actionName`. No reliance on `Map` insertion order or input
  order from the embedding search.
- **Quantize scores** to a fixed precision (or define an explicit epsilon) before
  threshold/margin comparisons, so float summation order can't flip a borderline decision.
- **Candidate-local IDF over a canonically-ordered candidate set (§9).** The
  discriminativeness math (and its telemetry) must see the colliding candidates in a stable
  sorted order — ties inside it resolve via the ordering above.

**Text processing**

- **Pin** the stemmer, Unicode normalization, and tokenizer versions; treat them
  as part of the determinism contract (snapshot-test the canonicalizer).
- **Domain-aware tokenizer with protected patterns** for product names,
  languages, file extensions, and refs (`C#`, `C++`, `.NET`, `A1:B2`, `xlsx`).

**Conversation state (the context vector, §7–§8)**

- **History-only** input: the current request never contributes to its own
  context profile.
- **Ring-buffer state is deterministic & invalidation-complete (§7.2).** The
  contextSelector-owned buffer must be a pure function of the request sequence and must
  reset on `@history clear` / session switch — no stale cross-session state, or "same
  conversation" stops meaning "same decision."
- **Decay from a stable turn index, not wall-clock (§8).** `λ^age` must use turn _position_,
  not elapsed time — otherwise the same conversation scores differently on a fast vs. slow
  replay, breaking fixture tests and benchmark replay.

**Note on the keyword pipeline.** LLM-distilled keywords (and the V2 knowPro source, §7.3)
are LLM-generated and therefore non-deterministic — **but only when the vector is produced**
(the offline distillation pass, or keyword-vector generation for a dynamically-added action). Each
action's vector is fixed once at that point and is not recomputed per request, so the
**collision-time scoring path that reads it stays fully deterministic**. The LLM in the
keyword pipeline does **not** violate G3.

All of the above ship **together** as v1: no manifest change, no onboarding-LLM in the hot
path, one integration point, a fixed correctness guard, and a trust-preserving affordance.
Delivers the named excel↔list scenario. Before `contextSelector.detect` flips on, a two-tier
local benchmark must show a net gain over today's funnel with **zero regressions** (§13.4–§13.6).

### 13.2 Deferred to later (stretch goals, not in v1)

Pulled in later only where local benchmarks show v1 abstaining too often or mis-resolving —
each explicitly **out of v1 scope**: the **V2 knowPro topic/entity source** (§7.3; requires
enabling agent-server-mode extraction first), per-action / sub-schema vectors, capped
**agent-of-record** (C-3; lock-in risk), **embedding-similarity scoring** (the planned step-3
upgrade once knowPro is the source — semantic match for synonyms, §9), the **F-3 both-path /
embedding-path coverage** (deterministic tiebreak only — no LLM saved), and **U-3
learned-preference bootstrap** (confirm-then-learn).

> The alternative lexical scorers (BM25, log-odds/Naive-Bayes) are **not** deferred upgrades —
> they were evaluated and rejected (§9); the intended scoring evolution is TF-IDF → embeddings.

### 13.3 Known gaps (accepted for v1)

- **Embedding/llmSelect-path collisions** are not handled — acceptable, since that path
  already selects a schema LLM-free (§4); contextSelector would save no LLM there anyway.
- **Same-agent / multi-domain collisions** (two schemas of one agent) rely on the
  schema/action granularity (§5); rare today.
- **Cache-masked collisions** — **resolved behind the registry-first opt-in (§11.4).** The
  construction cache short-circuits the grammar store on any hit (completion-based
  `AgentCache.match`), and a learned/built-in construction lives in a single agent's namespace, so
  an ambiguous phrase the cache has committed returns a **single** validated match. On the ordinary
  grammar path `contextSelector` needs ≥2 candidates (`resolveContextSelector` → `skip` below 2),
  so the cached answer would win and topic never weigh in — the reason live demos need
  `@const builtin off`. This is now handled by a **Tier-1.5 `contextSelector` step inside
  registry-first** (`resolveGrammarRegistryFirst`, §11.4): the neighborhood registry flags the
  single cache match as known-ambiguous (`detectRegistryAmbiguity`), re-expands it into its
  neighborhood siblings, and feeds the whole set to the match-agnostic TF-IDF scorer, which
  resolves the topical winner automatically (a cache-match winner routes with no LLM; a sibling
  winner records a request-scoped topical route and falls through to translation), falling back to
  the registry clarify on abstain. **Residual gap:** this only activates with a populated
  neighborhood registry (`preference.registryPath`) and `preference.registryFirst: on` (both
  empty/off by default), so in the stock config a cache-committed phrase still masks the collision. A
  cheaper root-fix that would cover the default config — mark neighborhood-member actions "never
  cache as a single-answer construction," keeping those phrases on the live grammar-collision path
  where `contextSelector` already works — remains open.
- **Registry-first can override the cache on a genuine multi-match** (accepted, §11.4). When
  `registryFirst` is on, a real multi-candidate cache collision is scored as the union of the
  validated matches and the flagged member's registry siblings, so a topically-strong sibling the
  cache didn't match can win the route, and enabling `registryFirst` can shift a multi-match decision
  vs validated-only scoring. This is intentional — the construction cache is not authoritative, and a
  strong recent-topic signal is allowed to correct a mis-committed cache entry. It is bounded by the
  abstain-biased evidence gates (extra contenders push toward the Tier-2 clarify, not a looser
  trigger) and the active-schema filter; `registryFirst: off` (default) keeps `contextSelector` on
  validated-only scoring for operators who want the stricter behavior.

### 13.4 Rollout & validation

No users and no production traffic, so there is **no real-traffic shadow phase**. The gate to
ship is a local, two-tier benchmark:

1. **Ship dark.** Land with `contextSelector.detect: off` — a simple on/off feature gate,
   invisible until flipped.
2. **Calibrate on unit fixtures (deterministic, no LLM).** Replay labeled collision scenarios —
   the `excel↔list` running example (§10, §14), the `calendar↔taskflow` case (§6.2), and the
   adversarial `list↔vampire` cluster from the shipped registry — to check every resolve/abstain
   decision and tune the evidence-gate thresholds (`minUniqueTokens` / `minMass` / `margin`).
   `λ=0.9` and `N=20` are fixed up front (§8) and re-validated here.
3. **Confirm net gain on the funnel benchmark (§13.5).** Run the end-to-end A/B/C and prove a net
   gain (accuracy and/or cost) with zero regressions.
4. **Flip `contextSelector.detect: on`** once both tiers pass.

Every decision emits telemetry — per-candidate score plus the matched `token→weight` pairs — so
both tiers are explainable and exact, not merely pass/fail.

### 13.5 Measuring net gain — the control and the scorecard

> **The one question this benchmark must answer: does adding `contextSelector` route more
> collisions correctly (or as correctly, but cheaper) than the system does today — without ever
> making a route it already gets right worse?**

**The control is the whole current funnel, not `first-match` alone.** A colliding request already
flows through several resolution layers before any answer comes back (§4):

```
grammar / cache match   (≥2 validated matches → collision)
  1. registry-first     (always)     → Tier-0 one-shot · Tier-1 preference → resolve (cache path, no LLM)
                                      · else Tier-2 registry clarify
                                      · pick names an unmatched sibling → fall through ↓
  2. contextSelector    (if detect)  → confident → resolve (cache path, no LLM)   ← inserts here
                                      · abstain → defer to strategy (default) | escalate-to-llm ↓
  3. collision strategy (if detect)  → first-match | score-rank | priority → resolve (cache path, no LLM)
                                      · user-clarify → clarify card
  ── only a registry fall-through, an escalate-to-llm abstain, or a Stage-1 miss continues: ──
     cache-miss path → embedding pickInitialSchema (no LLM) → LLM translation
```

The shape matters for everything below: **most collisions resolve on the cache path with no
LLM.** The `first-match` / `score-rank` / `priority` strategies each return a Stage-1 match
(`matchCollision.ts`), so a collision reaches the translator only on a registry fall-through, an
`escalate-to-llm` abstain, or a Stage-1 miss (§4).

So the **control** is this exact funnel with `contextSelector` disabled (its slot abstains
always). Because the default fallback — `first-match` — is itself LLM-free, the benchmark needs
**two baselines, one per axis**: a silent accuracy baseline and an escalate-to-llm cost baseline.
`user-clarify` is excluded from both — it interrupts the user, so it is not apples-to-apples with
a silent selector (it is the correctness _ceiling_, not a control).

**A/B/C configuration** (`grammarMatch.detect` on for all three — measure-only; with `first-match`
the behavior is identical to legacy, `matchRequest.ts`):

| Arm                      | `contextSelector` | fallback when unresolved | reaches LLM? | measures          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------- |
| **Control-A (accuracy)** | off               | `first-match`            | no           | accuracy baseline |
| **Treatment-B**          | on                | `first-match` on abstain | no           | accuracy · cost   |
| **Control-C (cost)**     | off               | `escalate-to-llm`        | yes          | cost baseline     |

Control-C has no production code path — `escalate-to-llm` exists only as a `contextSelector`
abstain mode (`matchRequest.ts`) — so arm C is a **benchmark-only harness toggle** that routes
every slot-reaching collision to the translator, purely to give Cost Δ a denominator.

**Scope the denominator honestly.** `contextSelector` runs _after_ registry-first and _ahead of_
the configured strategy (`matchRequest.ts`); it can never override a Tier-0 one-shot or a Tier-1
preference — those short-circuit upstream. So the measurable denominator is **N = collisions that
reach the contextSelector slot** (they pass registry-first); report N with every result. Cases a
preference / one-shot / registry already resolves are included only to prove **non-interference**
(treatment ≡ control there by construction).

**Ground truth** is the corpus's authored target per phrase — the same label `@collision corpus
run` uses to classify CLEAN / TIGHT / MISROUTE. The scorecard is a three-way per collision,
`groundTruth × outcome(control) × outcome(treatment)`, rolling up to three numbers:

| Metric          | Question                                                                                          | Baseline | Target            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| **Accuracy Δ**  | Did routing get _more_ correct than the silent control?                                           | A        | ≥ 0 (ideally > 0) |
| **Cost Δ**      | How many LLM translations do confident picks eliminate? _(0 vs `first-match`, already LLM-free.)_ | C        | ≥ 0               |
| **Regressions** | Control-right → treatment-wrong (a route we used to get right, now broken)                        | A        | **0 — hard gate** |

**Ship if** regressions = 0 (vs A), accuracy does not drop, and at least one axis is a strict
win — more correct routes (vs A) _or_ the same routes at fewer LLM calls (vs C). Net gain may come
from **either** axis: the value proposition (§11) is a confident pick that routes well on the
cache path _instead of_ escalating to the LLM. The regression count is the release gate — the
abstain bias (§10) exists precisely to keep it at zero, so the benchmark's real job is to _prove_
that, not merely to tally wins.

**Controlling LLM noise.** The accuracy comparison (A vs B) is entirely LLM-free and therefore
deterministic — its gate never rests on a stochastic run. Where the LLM _is_ in the loop (the cost
arm C, registry fall-throughs, cache-miss translation), pin translation to temperature 0 with a
fixed seed and count a regression only if it reproduces across replays. The deterministic unit
tier (§13.4) carries the precise threshold calibration.

Reuse the existing corpus pipeline (`@collision corpus run`) as the end-to-end harness, and the
`firstMatchCandidate` telemetry field — already recorded on every collision (`matchCollision.ts`)
— as the built-in `first-match` comparator.

### 13.6 Layer ablation (secondary — apples-to-apples per layer)

> **Lower priority than §13.5.** Net gain vs. the control is the release gate; the ablation is a
> follow-on that tells us _which layers still earn their slot_ once `contextSelector` exists —
> i.e. whether any can be simplified away.

Because the layers form a cascade, a layer's value is **conditional on the layers downstream of
it**, and leave-one-out deltas do **not** sum. So the useful artifact is not a single scalar but
an **overlap matrix**: for each collision, record which layer _would_ resolve it and to what,
scored against ground truth, then read off each layer's _unique_ contribution.

| For a case a layer resolves correctly, it is also caught by… | reading                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| a cheaper upstream layer (e.g. `first-match`)                | redundant — **skip candidate**     |
| only the LLM tail                                            | pure **cost** win (saves the call) |
| **no other layer**                                           | **unique contribution — keep**     |

**Concrete skip candidates to settle, per automatic layer:**

| Layer                         | Question the ablation answers                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `score-rank` vs `first-match` | Do they ever diverge, and is `score-rank` right when they do? (the open question in `collision-rollout.md`) |
| `priority`                    | Does a static order still pay once `contextSelector` supplies a dynamic topical signal?                     |
| `contextSelector`             | Unique correct routes over the LLM tail, or purely a cost optimization?                                     |
| embedding `pickInitialSchema` | Is its pick ever consequential when the translator runs regardless?                                         |

**Two guardrails on the ablation:**

- **Do not ablate the user-intent layers on accuracy.** Tier-0 one-shot and Tier-1 learned
  preferences encode _explicit user intent_ ("remember this choice"), not topical correctness —
  their ground truth is the user's stated preference. They are constraints, not routers; hold them
  fixed and scope the ablation to the automatic layers above.
- **Results are corpus-dependent.** A layer that looks redundant on today's agent mix may matter
  on another; always report the corpus and the denominator alongside any "skip" recommendation.

## 14. Worked examples

A full end-to-end trace exercising every locked decision. Running collision: the user says
_"add a row"_, which the grammar matches for both `excel.addRow` and `list.addItems`
(Stage 1, §4).

**Candidates — flattened keyword vectors (§6, §9)** — shared by both scenarios below.

- `excel.addRow` → `{excel, spreadsheet, cell, formula, pivot table, workbook, row, column}`
- `list.addItems` → `{list, item, todo, grocery, shopping, checklist}`

### Scenario 1 — Resolve (a clear topical winner)

**Recent user turns, tokenized into the ring buffer (§7, most recent first; the current
"add a row" is excluded — history-only, §10).**

| age | prior user turn → canonical tokens (§12)               |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | "fix the spreadsheet formula" → `spreadsheet, formula` |
| 2   | "which cell has that formula" → `cell, formula`        |
| 3   | "open the excel spreadsheet" → `excel, spreadsheet`    |
| 4   | "scroll to the last row" → `row`                       |

**Context vector — recency-decayed (§8, `λ=0.9`, weight = Σ `λ^age`).**

| token       | ages | weight `Σ 0.9^age`     |
| ----------- | ---- | ---------------------- |
| formula     | 1, 2 | 0.90 + 0.81 = **1.71** |
| spreadsheet | 1, 3 | 0.90 + 0.73 = **1.63** |
| cell        | 2    | **0.81**               |
| excel       | 3    | **0.73**               |
| row         | 4    | **0.66**               |

⇒ `C ≈ { formula:1.71, spreadsheet:1.63, cell:0.81, excel:0.73, row:0.66 }`.

**Score — D-4, candidate-local IDF (§9).** None of these tokens appear in _both_ candidate
sets, so each is fully distinguishing (`disc = 1`). `score(a) = Σ_{t ∈ C ∩ K_a} C[t]·disc`:

- `excel.addRow` matches all five (`formula, spreadsheet, cell, excel, row`) → **≈ 5.54**, across **5 distinct tokens**.
- `list.addItems` matches none → **0**.

**Decision — the four checks (§10), in order.**

1. **Coverage** — both candidates have non-empty keyword vectors ✓
2. **History-only** — `C` was built from turns _before_ "add a row" ✓
3. **Evidence gate** — excel matched 5 distinct tokens (≥ `minUniqueTokens` 2) ✓, mass 5.54 (≥ `minMass`) ✓
4. **Clear-winner margin** — 5.54 vs 0, decisive ✓

⇒ **Resolve to `excel.addRow`** — deterministically, on the grammar/cache path with **no LLM
call** (F-2), surfacing the U-2 affordance: _"↪ routed to Excel — recent topic · change"_.
The decision is fully explainable from counts: _matched {formula, spreadsheet, cell, excel,
row} (5 ≥ 2), mass 5.54, runner-up 0._

### Scenario 2 — Abstain (a genuine tie)

Same collision, but the recent conversation has touched **both** topics roughly equally —
the case where abstaining is exactly right (let the existing tiers ask or decide).

**Recent user turns (history-only, §7/§10):**

| age | prior user turn → canonical tokens (§12)                    | leans |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| 1   | "fix the spreadsheet formula" → `spreadsheet, formula`      | excel |
| 2   | "eggs for the grocery + shopping run" → `grocery, shopping` | list  |
| 3   | "my todo checklist" → `todo, checklist`                     | list  |
| 4   | "open excel, select the cell" → `excel, cell`               | excel |

**Context vector — decayed (§8, `λ=0.9`):**
`C ≈ { spreadsheet:0.90, formula:0.90, grocery:0.81, shopping:0.81, todo:0.73, checklist:0.73, excel:0.66, cell:0.66 }`

**Scores — D-4, candidate-local IDF (§9)** (still no token shared between the two sets, so
`disc = 1` throughout):

- `excel.addRow` matches `{spreadsheet, formula, excel, cell}` → 0.90+0.90+0.66+0.66 = **3.11**, 4 tokens
- `list.addItems` matches `{grocery, shopping, todo, checklist}` → 0.81+0.81+0.73+0.73 = **3.08**, 4 tokens

**Decision — the four checks (§10):**

1. **Coverage** — both non-empty ✓
2. **History-only** — built from prior turns ✓
3. **Evidence gate** — the top candidate (excel, 3.11) matches 4 distinct tokens (≥ 2) with
   ample mass ✓ — there _is_ plenty of signal
4. **Clear-winner margin** — 3.11 vs 3.08, gap **0.034** → **fails** the margin ✗

⇒ **Abstain.** Both candidates are strongly on-topic, so this is _genuine_ ambiguity, not a
weak signal — exactly when contextSelector should _not_ guess. The candidate set passes
through **unchanged** to the configured grammar strategy (default `first-match`; or
`user-clarify`/`priority` if set), which decides as it would today (§11.1).

> The margin check is what separates this from Scenario 1: both clear the _evidence_ gate, but
> only Scenario 1 has a clear _winner_. Without the margin, a 0.034 lead would silently route
> to excel — a coin-flip dressed up as a decision.

### Other abstain modes (brief)

- **No signal** — recent turns about scheduling (`C ≈ {meeting:…, calendar:…}`): neither
  candidate matches → both score 0 → evidence gate fails → **abstain**.
- **Coverage gap** — `list.addItems` has no keywords yet → coverage check fails → **abstain**
  (don't let excel win just for being covered).

In every abstain case the candidate set passes through **unchanged**, so contextSelector is
strictly additive — it can only resolve a collision the existing tiers would have, never make
routing worse.

## 15. Alternatives opted against

A running record of options considered and rejected as decisions are locked, kept
out of the main flow so the body reads as the chosen design.

### Part A — where keyword data lives (decided §5)

| Rejected option                                      | Why not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A-1** keywords on `AppAgentManifest` (agent-level) | Wrong granularity: one agent can own several schemas (`subActionManifests`), so two colliding `(schema, action)` candidates of the _same_ agent would get identical keyword vectors and permanently abstain. Also requires an agent re-ship to edit. |
| **A-4** keywords in profile / runtime-learned state  | Keywords are agent-descriptive — identical for every user — so they are not user data and do not belong in a per-user profile.                                                                                                                       |

_Folded into the decision rather than rejected: **A-2** supplies the correct
schema/action granularity, **A-3** supplies live, re-ship-free tuning — the
decision uses both (A-2 defaults + A-3 overrides)._

### Part B — keyword production (decided §6)

| Rejected option                               | Why not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Embedding-cluster action vectors → labels** | Heavier and opaque, and the labeling step usually needs an LLM — collapsing back into the offline-distillation drift/dependency profile without its review/control. (Whether the _scorer_ may use embeddings is a separate open Part D question; embedding-derived _keywords_ are out.) |

_Folded into the decision rather than rejected: LLM distillation, lexical extraction, and
misroute mining are **layered, not competitors** — see §6. Each action's vector prefers
**LLM distillation** (higher quality — synonyms the schema never says) and falls back to a
**deterministic lexical floor** that guarantees coverage of every action (including
un-distilled and dynamic agents); misroute mining and learned preferences then sharpen only the
colliding few via the sidecar. Distillation-only loses guaranteed coverage; lexical-only loses
quality — so distillation is preferred with lexical as the floor._

### Part C(i) — conversation signal source (decided §7)

| Rejected / deferred                                      | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source = `ChatHistory`** (C-4's premise)               | In agent-server mode (our target) `ChatHistory` has no user entries — `requestKnowledgeExtraction` is `false` there (§7.1). A `ChatHistory`-derived context vector would be empty exactly where contextSelector runs. |
| **C-3** agent-of-record (recent winners)                 | Self-reinforcing feedback loop → lock-in on a prior winner; needs caps + same-pair exclusion before it's safe. Deferred behind local benchmark data.                                                                  |
| **C-2 via `ChatHistory` entities** as the primary signal | The entities that survive agent-server mode are _action-result_ (system-output) entities, not the user's phrasing — output-biased. The richer user-topic signal is V2 (knowPro topics/entities) instead.              |

_Folded into the decision: V1 raw-token map (deterministic, agent-server-safe — a simple start
for benchmarking) and V2 knowPro topics/entities (the intended source, owned by the
conversation-memory system of record) behind one source seam — see §7._

### Part D — scoring algorithm (decided §9)

| Rejected (not on the roadmap)                | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **D-1** pure cosine                          | Angle-only ⇒ `{excel:1}` and `{excel:100}` score identically; rewards tiny vectors; fixed confidence threshold uncalibratable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **D-2** weighted dot product (no IDF)        | "D-4 minus discriminativeness" — long-list/keyword-stuffing bias; generic shared tokens inflate both candidates. Choosing candidate-local IDF already subsumes it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **D-3** BM25-lite                            | Built for long, length-varied documents; our ~8-token keyword lists are tiny/uniform so length-norm does little, and `k1`/`b` have no data to tune. TF runaway already bounded by decay (§8) + the evidence gate (§10). **Not pursued** — the intended next step is embeddings, not a lexical refinement.                                                                                                   |
| **D-5** log-odds / Naive-Bayes               | The per-token `log[P(t\|a1)/P(t\|a2)]` is what candidate-local IDF approximates (D-4 ≈ smoothing-free log-odds). A "real" D-5 must fabricate `P(token\|a)` from tiny keyword lists → mandatory smoothing whose parameter dominates, illusory calibration without labeled data, independence-assumption overconfidence. **Not pursued** — D-4 already captures the useful part; the next gain is embeddings. |
| **Positional weighting** (reciprocal/capped) | Order signal is a third, noisier proxy already covered by `disc × C`; stacking three uncalibrated multipliers risks one factor dominating. **Flattened (set)** for v1; capped positional weighting parked as a tuning lever.                                                                                                                                                                                |

_Folded into the decision: the scoring roadmap is **TF-IDF now → embedding similarity later**.
**D-4** = candidate-local IDF-weighted token overlap with flattened keyword vectors (ships now,
unchanged when the source becomes knowPro entities); **embedding similarity** is the one
forward step that adds semantic matching (evaluated once knowPro is the source, flagged per §2).
Cosine/dot-product/BM25/log-odds are evaluated and set aside, not deferred upgrades — see §9._

### Part E — decision rule (decided §10)

| Rejected option                                           | Why                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **E-1** absolute threshold + margin on a **cosine** score | Cosine magnitude isn't calibratable across conversations (§9); cosine dropped anyway.                         |
| **E-3** relative ratio `s1/s2 ≥ ρ`                        | Runner-up is frequently ~0 (shared tokens cancel) → ratio explodes / divides by zero; needs an awkward floor. |
| **E-4** z-score / rank-gap                                | Needs a population of candidate scores; collisions are usually 2 candidates, where a z-score is meaningless.  |

_Chosen: an **absolute** evidence gate (`minUniqueTokens` + `minMass`) plus an absolute
discriminative `margin` — readable in count units and divide-by-zero-free; see §10._

### Part F — integration & UX (decided §11)

| Rejected option                                    | Why                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **F-1** standalone tier on **both** paths          | Two insertions; duplicates wiring; the llmSelect side saves no LLM.                                                                                    |
| **F-3** inside `resolvePreferenceClarify`          | One change covers both paths and reuses consent/learning — but couples to `preference-clarify` plumbing; revisit only if both-path coverage is wanted. |
| **F-4** dynamic `priorityOrder` feeding `priority` | Re-derives priority per request (surprising for a "static" knob); no evidence gate / abstain semantics.                                                |
| **U-1** pure-silent reroute                        | Product's first zero-consent invisible reroute; no correction affordance. Opt-in only.                                                                 |
| **U-3** confirm-once → learned preference → silent | Bridges into the existing consent model and bootstraps Tier-1 prefs — documented as a future enhancement (pairs with F-3).                             |

_Chosen: **F-2** grammar/cache-path-only insertion (the only place it avoids an LLM), abstain
defaults to deferring to today's strategy, and **U-2** a visible non-blocking affordance; see §11._
