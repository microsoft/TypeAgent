# TODO (Mac version)

**How much of this is still valid?**

- Big files need to be truly broken up
- Creating summaries is insanely slow (15000 lines took 20+ minutes)
- Most files don't get a toplevel summary (fix in prompt?)
- Summaries are kind of short
- Dependencies aren't really there except external modules

- Maybe embeddings aren't the right way to match keywords etc.?
- Maybe use classing stemming etc.?

- Recall is still pathetic
- Need to work on how to combine keywords etc. with summary hits
- Need to work at least some of the words in the code into embeddings
- It seems everything in the keywords (etc.) index is close to everything else

- Do we trust vector normalization?
