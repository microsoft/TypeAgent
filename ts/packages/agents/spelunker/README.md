## Spelunker demo agent

This demo agent is used to explore ideas around "code spelunking", i.e.,
exploring a repo full of unknown source code (in multiple languages) and
gradually understand how it works. The AI is meant as a helper for the human to
help them think. See [Design](./design.md) for the current architecture.
