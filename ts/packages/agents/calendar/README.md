# Calendar Agent

This package contains the schema defintion and implemtation for implementing a Calendar Agent
that interacts with the Outlook using MS Graph APIs.

This agent depends on the utility library [graph-utils](../agentUtils/graphUtils/src/calendarClient.ts) to implement different calendar actions.

To build the calendar agent, it needs to provide a manifest and an instantiation entry point.  
These are declared in the `package.json` as export paths:

- `./agent/manifest` - The location of the JSON file for the manifest.
- `./agent/handlers` - an ESM module with an instantiation entry point.

### Manifest

When loading calendar agent in a NPM package, the dispatcher first loads the [calendarManifest.json](./src/calendarManifest.json).

### Sample User Requests

To work with the MS Graph, we need a valid demo tenant which comes with pre-existing M365 users. In order to see the calendar event you will need to set that up.
