# Calendar Agent

Calendar agent is **sample code** that explores how to build a typed calendar agent with **TypeChat**. This package contains the schema defintion and implementation for building a Calendar Agent that interacts the Outlook mail client using Microsoft Graph API. This [article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/tutorials/typescript-app-only?tabs=aad) explores how to work with typescript and Microsoft Graph APIs. Please visit the [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/calendar?view=graph-rest-1.0) to learn about calendar specific Microsoft Graph APIs.

This agent depends on the utility library [graph-utils](../agentUtils/graphUtils/src/calendarClient.ts) to implement different calendar actions.

The calendar agent uses the Microsoft Graph API to interact with the user's calendar. The agent uses `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client` library to interact with the Microsoft Graph API. The agent enables operations like create, update, delete, find etc on calendar events.

To build the calendar agent, it needs to provide a manifest and an instantiation entry point.  
These are declared in the `package.json` as export paths:

- `./agent/manifest` - The location of the JSON file for the manifest.
- `./agent/handlers` - an ESM module with an instantiation entry point.

### Prerequisites

The code uses Microsoft Graph to access your Microsoft account, Azure Active Directory, and Outlook Microsoft Graph API. Microsoft Graph [quickstart](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/quick-start?state=option-typescript) example makes it easy to create you own graph client. Once you have created your garph client application and demo tenant you can update the following variables in the `.env` file:

```
MSGRAPH_APP_CLIENTID
MSGRAPH_APP_CLIENTSECRET
MSGRAPH_APP_TENANTID
```

Note: You have to just do this once to create a Graph Client application.

### Manifest

When loading calendar agent in a NPM package, the dispatcher first loads the [calendarManifest.json](./src/calendarManifest.json).

### Fix issues with identity cache

The calendar agent uses the `@azure/identity-cache-persistence` package to persist the user's identity information using device code flow, if you are facing issues with the identity cache, you can clear the cache by running the following commands:

```
cd %localappdata%/.IdentityService
del typeagent-tokencache*
```
