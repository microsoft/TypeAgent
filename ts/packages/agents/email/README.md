# Email Agent

Email agent is **sample code** that explores how to build a typed email agent with **TypeChat**. This package contains the schema defintion and implementation for building a Email Agent that interacts the Outlook mail client using Microsoft Graph API. This [article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/tutorials/typescript-app-only?tabs=aad) explores how to work with typescript and Microsoft Graph APIs. Please visit the [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/mail-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) to learn about more about email specific Microsoft Graph APIs.

This agent depends on the utility library [graph-utils](../graphUtils/src/mailClient.ts) to implement different email actions.

The email agent uses the Microsoft Graph API to interact with the user's email. The agent uses `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client` library to interact with the Microsoft Graph API. The agent enables operations to compose, reply, and get email messages.

To build the email agent, it needs to provide a manifest and an instantiation entry point.  
These are declared in the `package.json` as export paths:

- `./agent/manifest` - The location of the JSON file for the manifest.
- `./agent/handlers` - an ESM module with an instantiation entry point.

### Prerequisites

The code uses Microsoft Graph to access your Microsoft account, Azure Active Directory, and Outlook Microsoft Graph API. Microsoft Graph [quickstart](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/quick-start?state=option-typescript) example makes it easy to create you own graph client. Once you have created your garph client application and demo tenant you can update the following variables in the `.env` file:

```
MSGRAPH_APP_CLIENTID
MSGRAPH_APP_CLIENTSECRET
MSGRAPH_APP_TENANTID
```

Note: You have to just do this once to create a `Graph Client` application.

### Manifest

When loading email agent in a NPM package, the dispatcher first loads the [emailManifest.json](./src/emailManifest.json).

### Fix issues with identity cache

The email agent uses the `@azure/identity-cache-persistence` package to persist the user's identity information using device code flow, if you are facing issues with the identity cache, you can clear the cache by running the following commands:

```
cd %localappdata%/.IdentityService
del typeagent-tokencache*
```

### Sample User Requests

```
Send email to Megan asking if she wants to meet for coffee and chat after work today.

Reply to the email from Megan saying you will be happy to meet for coffee.

Forward the mail from Megan to Alex asking if he wants to join us for coffee.

Send an email to Alex with the recipe for Lasagna.
```
