The settings agent is **sample code** that explores how a host system settings agent _could_ work.

The sample demonstrates:

- How to use schema to get a **structured** [Settings Response](./src/settingActionSchema.ts) from the LLM.
- How to place response cards in the agent responses.
- Explores what a system settings agent could be designed.
