This project has two components

1. .NET code which integrates with Windows shell APIs to manage desktop UI. To build this:

   - Launch Visual Studio
   - Open the repo directory [dotnet/autoShell](../../../../dotnet/autoShell/) folder. Build this project.

2. The node process that integrates with TypeAgent. To build this:
   - Go to the repo directory [ts/packages/agents/desktop](./) folder.
   - Run `pnpm run build`

## Running the automation

1. In the repo directory [ts/packages/agents/desktop](./), run `pnpm run start`
2. Launch the [TypeAgent Shell](../../shell) or the [TypeAgent CLI](../../cli). These are integrated with the automation agent and can send commands. You can issue commands from this interface such as:
