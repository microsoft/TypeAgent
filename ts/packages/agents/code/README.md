# VSCODE Automation Extension

The code agent is sample code to demonstrate how to automate vscode.

The code dispatcher agent is not enabled by default. It is integrated to work with the vscode extension [coda](../../coda/README.md). Please deploy the vscode extension to see the code agent in action.

You can enable the code agent by typing these commands in the typeagent cli or shell:

```
@config translator code.code-debug
@config action code.code-debug
```

Please look at the agent [manifest](./src/codeManifest.json) file to look at other sub-agents that are part of the code agent. The code agent shows how to extend an agent to handle a hierarchical set of actions. For instance if you want to run different commands related to debugging an application on vscode, you will want to run these commands:

```
@config translator code.debug
@config action code.debug
```

You can enable all the sub-agents as part of the code agent by running the following commands on the typeagent cli or shell:

```
@config action code*
@config translator code*
```
