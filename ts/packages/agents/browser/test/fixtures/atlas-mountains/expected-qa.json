They established various dynasties that ruled much of North Africa during the medieval period. The mountains served as a refuge and stronghold throughout history, including during Roman expansion (which never fully conquered the mountain areas) and later resistance to French colonial rule in Morocco and Algeria. The Berber presence represents a continuous cultural thread connecting ancient North African civilization to the present day.",

      "expectedAnswer": "While both are major mountain ranges, the Atlas Mountains and Himalayas were formed by different tectonic collisions. The Atlas Mountains resulted from the African-Eurasian plate collision during the Alpine orogeny, while the Himalayas formed from the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates. The Himalayas are significantly higher (with peaks over 8,000m) compared to the Atlas Mountains (highest peak 4,167m). The comparison helps geologists understand different mountain building processes globally.",
