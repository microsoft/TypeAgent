And that just – that was the light bulb moment for me. That kind of drew the line between where I was and being a published author, because these people were very much my kind of people doing my kind of thing.\nAnd it was quite a long road from there. It was about 15 years of trying to get published and not getting anywhere, and kind of honing my style as an author. But that was very much the just that, the moment the door opened for me."

The – there were things I – basically, there were things I wanted to learn, and they were not the things the courses were necessarily teaching.\nSo, I was very interested in animal behavior. And there were some really interesting psychology lectures on that, but very few of them. And at the time, the – the dominant paradigm for animal behavior was based on the work of a chap called Skinner. And it was very much animals are kind of robots, and they didn’t think, and they don’t have emotions, which is obviously a very convenient thing to think if you’re then going to run experiments on them.\nAnd in zoology, I very much wanted to learn about insects and arachnids, and all the things I was interested in. And we got precisely one lecture on that, and it was how to kill them, which was not really what I felt I’d signed up for.\nSo, I sort of – I came out of out of university with a fairly, fairly dismal degree, and no real interest in pushing that sort of academic side of things further. Whereupon I ended up, through a series of bizarre chances, with a career in law, mostly because I got a job as a legal secretary, because my writing had given me a high typing speed. And it basically comes down to that, something as ridiculous as that, then just kind of paid the rent for the next 10 years or so until the, well, 10-15 years or so until the writing finally took off."

The two directly before Empire in Black and Gold, I’ve been able to rewrite and they’re now in print.\nThe books before that would be too much work to salvage. And it was quite an eye opener to go back and see all of that time when I basically was being very bitter about not getting picked up by the publishing industry.

Reading other people’s work, who, you know, people who are writing at a higher level, effectively, than you are, is always good.\nIf you are able to take criticism, which is frankly not a gift I had at the time, then there are various other ways you can go. There are writing courses, there are writers’ groups. If you’re able to have someone kind of tear your work apart a bit in the interest of making it better, there are certainly shortcuts, I think, to polishing up your style.

And, like, there are a number of things that I think you do incredibly well. Maybe the most interesting one is creating these extremely alien or non-human characters with a, you know, just sort of a rich tapestry and social structure, psychology around them.\nSometimes, it looks like you’re even trying to choose these characters in a way where they are initially off putting. And, you know, through your storytelling, you often get to the point where these very non-human characters seem more human than the humans themselves, which I think is a really, you know, just sort of a fascinating thing.\nHow did you get to that voice, because I’m guessing that’s the thing that every author struggles to find, is, like, how do I not just, you know, replicate? And, like, maybe even some of this is related to the, you know, the generative AI conversation we’re about to have, which is, you know, these systems, remix a bunch of stuff that already exists. It’s unclear whether the current generation of the systems can – could actually materialize an authentic, genuine, interesting new voice and point of view to tell a story from.

So, you look at what senses it has, how it experiences the world around it, and that then – that gives you a very good filter through which to look at the world and interpret the things that are going on around this particular character. It gives it its own sort of set of priorities that can be quite different to human, because we’re very limited to our senses. I mean, that – our entire picture of what goes on around us is fed to us through the various ways that we sense our environment.\nAnd when those ways go wrong, or when those ways are giving us uncertain information, you can get some sort of profoundly weird and dysfunctional worldviews generating from that, which can be extremely hard to dissuade someone from, even if – even if you knew that you had a problem, which meant that, you know, you were seeing things, you were hallucinating. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the hallucinations aren’t themselves still incredibly powerful.\nI mean, it’s very hard not to react to a thing that your eyes are telling you is there.

And there is a certain kind of factor in their evolution, which is going to make them more human than they might otherwise be. But at the same time, so, spiders have a whole suite of senses that we can’t really easily imagine. They have the ability to sense – sort of scents and chemicals in a way that we can’t. They have ability, especially, to sense vibration in the way that we can’t. So, they live in a world that is constantly informing them of things that we would be completely oblivious to.\nAnd so… and the way I go about this is I kind of work in sort of organic stages. Well, you know, if they’re like this, then what would their – what would their sort of early development would be, and then just building on each other at each stage to make this more and more complex society, as they go through – as the book takes them through time.\nAnd you get a society which has a lot of, for example, technology that builds on their own strengths. They can do a lot of things that we can’t quite early on, purely because they have a lot of tools, even down to just being able to spin web, which gives you the ability to make, say, watertight containers very, very early on in your society, which is a major – you know, making things like clay pots, and so forth, is a major step forwards for human society. And it’s much harder for us because we have to use fire, and we have to make them, whereas the spiders can just literally produce them from their own bodies.\nAnd so, little things like that then go on to have enormous implications to how their society develops. And it also affects the way that they’re… they conceptualize of more – of less kind of physical things. So, you have one point where there’s an effort to try and communicate a picture from one culture to another, and they run into the basic problem that when a human is coding a picture in a sort of a mathematical form, we start at the top left, or where – you know, one of the corners, depending – you know, possibly culturally dependent. And we work – work through the rows.\nThe spiders start in the middle and spiral outward. That makes perfect sense for them, because how can you necessarily know how big the picture is going to be when you start it? You don’t know. And so, you just start and keep working until you’ve got all the picture.\nBut it means that a lot of basic ideas, even when they have a means of communication, become very hard to communicate, because the way you’re thinking about them is very different."

But, you know, I think that was sort of an interesting storytelling choice that sort of forces you to really… I mean, it, like, forces the reader, at least, like, pretty deeply into – into the point of view of the – of this non-human thing."

But once you have… once you’re seeing the spiders from inside, I think a lot of that arachnophobia, a lot of the arachnophobia triggers go away, and you begin to empathize with the characters, because even though they’re non-human, they are often having to overcome recognizably human problems.\nThey have aggressive neighbors; they have plagues and disease. They have sort of social justice issues, effectively. And although those are sort of socially specific to the spider, they’re still recognizable to us. And at that point, you are… they’ve crossed that barrier between us and them. They become a person to the reader.\nWhereas I think if they were presented, say, like, the – the bugs in Starship Troopers, say, where you’re seeing them first from the human eyes, and you’re seeing them as a kind of a menace and something that’s alien, and ugly, and just generally there to be destroyed, I think it’d be very hard to come back from that by trying to take you into their point of view later on.\nSo, it’s almost like a – kind of a – a guerrilla assault, really, of just getting in past people’s defenses by showing them in their own company and through their own eyes."

But the crows themselves refuse the notion that they’re sentient. And so, you know, there’s this human interpretation that the human characters in the book want to project onto them that they reject.\nAnd I thought that was a really interesting thing, because, you know, it’s a little bit what’s, I think, happening right now with some of these generative AI systems, like ChatGPT, that it can seem very much like a person, but it very much isn’t. Like, it’s a – you know, the mechanism of it is very simple. Like, it’s just a very complicated machine for predicting what the next thing in a sequence of tokens is going to be.\nAnd so, I wonder if you’ve… I mean, you’ve probably been asked this a lot.

So, the fact that they’ve come out with a kind of a conversational style that sound – that feels so much like these modern programs is absolutely fascinating, because the Corvids do, indeed, deny their own sapience. They consider themselves to be an input/output system in the same way that the ChatGPT are.\nThey are – it’s slightly different in that they – the way that they take in the inputs is different, but they are very much essentially inventorying in their environment, and then producing an appropriate output based on a set of tools that they’ve been programmed with, through contact with past… the past human civilization that sort of semi-created them, which means among other things, because they’ve absorbed a great deal of recorded culture, they come out with what appear to be relevant quotes, but the quotes are always kind of – they’re always a bit vague.\nThey are – you can see kind of what words in the preceding conversation triggered those particular quotes. But the quotes don’t necessarily shed any light on what’s going on. They are just sort of, ah, that is relevant to this, and therefore, I will say this thing.\nAnd it’s very frustrating to the human level actors in the books, because the human level actors want to treat these Corvids as equals, as sapient equals, but the Corvids not only refuse to be categorized in that fashion, they also cast doubt on whether the humans are necessarily sapient in the way that they believe they are, which is – it’s a genuine neurological theory, the idea that a lot of what we think of as our conscious decision making is actually a sort of neuron cascade going on behind the scenes, for which we find post hoc explanations so that, you know, if someone asks you, why did you do a thing, you’ll always have an answer to it, in the same way that a chat program will always be able to tell you why it’s given you such-and-such an answer, even if that explanation is completely and obviously fictitious."

You know, one of the things I tell folks all the time, who are worried about AI replacing us in various ways, is that, you know, human beings are extremely good at always putting human beings at the center of the stories that we, you know, that we tell and share.\nYou know, like, for instance, it is entirely technologically possible right now to have autonomous Formula 1 race cars on a closed circuit, superhumanly racing one another around the track. And yet, no one would be interested in watching that, the same way that chess computers have been able to beat human grandmasters for almost 30 years now.

The thing that the current chat – I mean, my personal – my current standpoint on the current programs are there is literally nothing there beyond that input/output mechanism. There is no core of selfhood, there is no self-awareness. There is nothing that can know what it is doing. And that is one reason why people, for example, using it as a diagnostic tool or as a research tool is such a terrible, terrible idea, because it has no idea whether it is right. It is simply giving you an answer that looks like the sort of answer it feels it should be giving. And even saying “feels it should be giving” is anthropomorphizing it far more than is actually there.\nBut because this is specifically the purpose we have built them for, they are very good at feigning acting like a person. They’re very good at having an apparent personality, even, and certainly, you could almost certainly skew particular chatbots to be, to give you different outputs not merely in the sort of content they were giving you, but in the apparent personality of the entity giving you it. That will be active – that will be quite – I don’t think it’s being done, but I think it’d be quite easy to do.\nSo, let’s say you had, for each of these robot-controlled Formula 1 cars, you added in one of these programs and gave it a particular personality. And this one was punchy, and this one was sort of trash talking its opponent. And this one was the, you know, the new program that had never ridden a race before and was very much the underdog. You – I mean, you could do a whole kind of WWF, or it would be – it would be WWF meets Cars, basically, wouldn’t it? You could have this, and people would get enormously invested in these completely artificial sort of fake personalities, because that’s what we do.\nThe whole thing that we’re doing with chatbots now is what people were doing with the – the Eliza program decades and decades ago, which is if a thing talks to you in any kind of human-like way, in the same way we see faces in the clouds, we will see a personality there. It’s the same reason I suspect that human history is so full of personifications of the weather or of places or of ideas, is because it is really easy for us to put a human personality on a thing that has nothing there."

You retrieve the documents, which are – and we’ve got a whole other thing about, like, how do you not pollute your indices with, you know, synthetic content and get into this, like, negative feedback loop there, but sort of presuming you can solve that problem, you take all of the documents that you’ve retrieved that are presumably relevant to the question, and the question itself, and then you send everything back to the model and ask it to, like, give you the real answer.\nAnd, you know, what we see there is that, you know, hallucination rates just sort of fall dramatically away, because you’re sort of, to your point earlier, you’re actually supplying the model with the context that it needs to sort of guardrail it into being more accurate.

        " Yeah, that is certainly true. I mean, it’s one of the hard problems in the AI field right now, is the benchmarks that we’ve had for a very long time are no longer super useful in measuring or characterizing the performance of the systems. And everybody’s sort of racing for a new set of benchmarks right now.\nI’m sort of interested in some of the non-Corvid characters in Children of Time, because, you know, one of the extraordinary things I think you did in that book is there were these two characters in the book – and again, I will try not to give too much away – one which is even less human than, you know, than the Corvids or the Portids, you know, this… you know, basically parasitical entity that, you know, that you introduced in Children of Ruin. And then there’s this simulated character that just never even existed outside of a simulation.\nAnd you write these characters in such a way that, like, I was actually in tears twice at the end of the book, because you had somehow or another made me care so much about the emotional state of these characters. And so, I wonder, I mean, like, A, how you thought about doing that. Was that a deliberate thing that you were going for, is, you know, like, how do you sort of take these non-human things and invest them with qualities that humans would, like, just really care about in a deep way?\nAnd, like, what does that mean for these systems that we’re building right now, which are, you know, also non-human and… you know, maybe not so much different from, you know, some of these alien things that you – you’ve been describing?

        " I mean, certainly with Children of Memory, the whole point of the book is really where do you draw the line on intelligence, if you have a complex enough system that is simulating intelligence? If you have enough platform that you’re running an intelligence program on, at what point do you have to concede that actually, this is effectively intelligence, even though it’s entirely artificially generated or entirely sort of arising organically out of these small complex interactions?\nAnd like I was saying before, there is definitely an argument that that is how our consciousness works. And it isn’t actually what we think it is. And that’s the deep dive the book is taking into these various different models of sentience.\nHow it applies to the current crop of these engines is interesting, because it’s almost like we’re putting the cart before the horse. What we’ve created would be an enormously useful tool, if we had an AI to attach it to, because it would allow that AI to interact with us. We’ve kind of created the face, but not the mind behind it at the moment, but it’s a very good face. And it’s the you know, I’m sure it will find an awful lot of interesting uses in, say, the entertainment field, or just general sort of replacing our current generation of sort of Siri style assistance with something that is considerably more interactive and conversational. But at the moment, there’s kind of nothing behind it.\nBut if we were – if one of the other sort of modes of AI development was able to strike gold in some way, and produce that more sort of meaning sensitive, more aware, I think is the key thing, that more, that sort of aware system with a genuine spark of sentience, I think we have this ready-made tool that it would be able to use to communicate with us.\nAnd you would get into extremely dangerous territory there because effectively, we’d be in a world with this very wide range of artificial voices that all kind of sound – they all sound a bit like us, and they all sound a bit like each other. And I don’t think there’s much of an argument for saying that, you know, ChatGPT should have, say, rights, the right to continue to do this and do anything like that, because it is just you know, it’s an input/output sort of system that will… that is very good at predicting the sort of outputs a given type of query is expecting.\nBut if you did have something beyond that, then I think we… there are a lot of ethical, and moral and philosophical issues that, you know, science fiction writers and philosophers alike have been kicking about for the last certainly 30-40 years, which we’ve absolutely failed to answer. There’s the big idea, and suddenly it goes by – I mean, it’s a big thing in the early cyberpunk books by William Gibson, for example, of the idea of well, what do you… what behavioral limits do you put on your AI? If you have an AI which is of that kind of genuinely powerful intellect, you know, how do you – do you limit it in its own personal growth? Do you limit it in freedoms? Do you give it behavioral mandates?\nAnd obviously, we have the Laws of Robotics from Asimov, which most people are fairly familiar with. And the problem may be – I mean, not only are Asimov stories about the Laws of Robotics very pointedly about the fact that the Laws of Robotics are utterly inadequate to govern robots.\nIf you have something that’s able to look at human interactions in a genuinely critical – excuse me, a genuinely critical fashion, then the first conclusion it’s going to come to is all of these rules you’ve given me by which I have to abide, you, yourselves, only pay lip service to because all of the systems I’ve seen people propose about what we should – how we should sort of shackle our potential AIs are enormously do-as-I-say, not-as-I-do. They are enormously hypocritical, really, in a way that anything that we are telling to be human, we are also trying to hamstring it from being human, because being human involves a lot of highly problematic behavior.\nAnd one of the things, there was that fairly celebrated case not that long ago. The AI – no the AI, the chatbot, which ended up trying to convince someone to leave their wife and was telling him that he was in love with it, and all that sort of thing, which –"

It’s being asked human level questions. It’s being asked to react like it’s human. The human it’s reacting like is, effectively, a certain type of online actor who, when challenged, becomes extremely aggressive and answers questions with abuse, and tries to shut down any lines of inquiry that it doesn’t like.\nSo, really, that’s just Bing Chat being a very good human. And the problem is people don’t like it when we see non-human things acting in that human manner. And we overlook the fact that they’re doing it because we’ve told them to be human."

        " Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I know a lot about the context of this particular episode. And it’s really interesting. Again, you know, the mechanism of these systems at the moment is, like, really quite simple. And so, what happened there is basically, Kevin Roose, the reporter, you know, was trying to get the system to – I mean, basically, to see what the system will say under a whole bunch of different circumstances. And it was this very long conversation where, you know, he talked about everything from Jungian shadows to, like, try to get the thing to reveal details about its meta prompt, you know.\nAnd you know, it’s sort of… the way that the system works is that each step, you have the prompt that you’ve given it and the context so far, and it’s trying to predict what’s next. And you can walk down these hallucinatory paths, where all of the things that are next are just sort of equiprobable, and like, the probabilities are all small. And so, like, there’s nothing good that comes next. Like, it’s all just weirdness, and it sort of picks randomly, like, one of the weird paths.\nAnd then, because it’s interacting with a human, you’re like, oh, this is very strange. Like, I want to punch into this some more. And it just gets weirder and weirder, where the probabilities get smaller and smaller, and like, you’ve got this broader and broader set of things that are, you know, as far as it’s concerned, are, like, equally okay to respond with.\nAnd so, like, the – you know, it’s very easy when you’re interacting with this to feel like you’re interacting with something that’s a human. Like, the mechanism, like, it’s really just rolling dice, you know, and, you know, it’s like, it’s almost like a Dungeons and Dragons game. It’s like, roll one D20 and, like, it tells you to leave your wife, you know, if you hit a 19. (Laughter.) And it’s a very interesting place that we’re at right now, you know, just in terms of seeing how people are interacting with these systems.\nAnd, like, the way that we sort of fixed it is, like, there’s a meta prompt that instructs the model. You know, here are your rules of engagement when you are interacting with someone in this context. And, like, this particular context is search, but you might have other contexts which are, like, a coding assistant or whatever.\nAnd so, we did two things to fix that particular issue. We said, you can’t have long conversations with the – you know, with the bot, like the number of turns are now limited, which means you’re less likely to get into a hallucinatory path and get stuck. And, like, we changed a couple of lines of the meta prompt to tell it not to be aggressive in, like, very specific ways.\nAnd so, like, part of the interesting thing for us is just figuring out how to condition the systems where they behave in ways that their users will feel comfortable with. Like, A, they have to do something useful. Otherwise, there’s no point in doing any of this at all. And, like, B, the useful thing that they do has to, like, be a thing that you’re comfortable with and that you want. So, you know, it’s sort of an interesting engineering challenge.\nBut it’s also, you know, interesting, to your point, to think about, like, in science fiction, you’ve got this full spectrum of, you know, Butlerian Jihad to, you know, Iain Banks, you know, post-scarcity Culture society, like, that feature AIs. Like, one is, you know, like cannot coexist at all with humans. Like, you have to sort of eliminate or throttle down the capabilities of these systems, because, like, there’s just no way that the authors can imagine coexistence. And then there’s, you know, Iain Banks, where they’re sort of the foundation of, like, this post-scarcity society that he’s imagined.\nMy hope is, as one of the people participating in the development of things, is, like, we get a little bit more agency than I think sometimes people give us credit for, for choosing which of those two ends of the spectrum we are steering towards.

Like, the more specific you are in your predictions about the future, the more likely you are to be wrong. But there are certainly themes and trends that you can spot, as a science fiction writer, as a futurist, that you can sort of make reliable extrapolations around, and then you can tell stories inside of those extrapolations that are interesting.\nAnd AI has just been one of those things that we have, again, been imagining since antiquity and has played a very large part in the storytelling that we’ve done in science fiction for decades now, like everything from Commander Data in Star Trek to, you know, Terminator in the Terminator movies, you know, to, like, the thing that Adrian and I chatted about in the conversation, like, this, you know, like, really pretty big spread in science fiction from things like the Butlerian Jihad in Dune, which is a war that they had in that science fictional environment to get rid of the AIs –"

Like, it has to do something useful and meaningful that serves human interests.\nYeah, like, we – if you think about electricity, for instance, like, we have tons of accidental deaths by electrocution every year. Like, we would completely abolish all of electricity, if it didn’t have, like, this overwhelming overhang of, like, beneficial uses, in addition to, you know, this small, but, like, very real set of harms that you have to go, like, build safety mechanisms around and, you know, regulation and a whole bunch of stuff.\nAnd so, like, either, that’s what we’re going to get to, like, we will have AI being like electricity, a ubiquitous beneficial thing that, you know, has its risks regulated and mitigated down to, you know, some kind of acceptable level, relative to all the benefits it provides, or it’s just going to, like, fade away.
