# knowpro

**Experimental prototype**:

- Working toward a shared understanding of the MVP for **structured RAG**.
- This exploration takes ideas and issues discovered in previous iterations and applies/solves them holistically.
- Earlier iterations (as used by current conversation memory and other examples), are in the [knowledge-processor](../knowledgeProcessor) package.
- In active development with very frequent changes.

This is **sample code** only.

**Goal**: early ideas that explore how to:

- Use TypeChat to extract **_structured knowledge_** from conversations, transcripts and documents.
- Implement a **Structured RAG**. The exploration includes ideas on how to:
  - Index the extracted knowledge and source text for retrieval.
  - Use TypeChat to generate **structured queries** for structured knowledge.
  - Use structured objects to **_answer_** questions.
  - Use structured indices to improve precision.
