thinking about the new grammar generator, it's really cool how we can use Claude to generate grammars from schemas
the key insight is using exact action names like scheduleEvent instead of ScheduleEvent so we can target specific actions when extending
also important that we use agr text files not JSON because they're way more compact and readable for Claude
next step is to think about incremental updates - when a new example comes in for scheduleEvent we just extend that one rule
we'll need to pass the existing grammar plus the new example plus info about shared symbols like <Polite>
