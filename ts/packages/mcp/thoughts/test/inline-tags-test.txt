thinking about the new grammar generator, it's really cool how we can use Claude to generate grammars from schemas. tag this as grammar design. the key insight is using exact action names like scheduleEvent instead of ScheduleEvent so we can target specific actions when extending. tag this as naming convention. also important that we use agr text files not JSON because they're way more compact and readable for Claude. tag this as file format. next step is to think about incremental updates - when a new example comes in for scheduleEvent we just extend that one rule. tag this as implementation strategy.
