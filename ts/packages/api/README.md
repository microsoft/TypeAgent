# TypeAgent HTTP API

## Overview

TypeAgent API is a HTTP+WS API server for **TypeAgent sample code**. It explores architectures for building distributed _interactive agents_ with _natural language interfaces_ using [TypeChat](https://github.com/microsoft/typechat). This interface shows devlopers one way of broadening the reach of Agents to web-enabled devices such as internet browsers, mobile phones, and IOT connected devices.

## Running

After setting up and building at the workspace root, there are several ways to start the server.

### Locally

The server can be started with `npm run start` in this package's directory. Then connect to `http://localhost:3000` using a web browser.

### Docker Image

It is possible to use the [docker image](../../Dockerfile) to host TypeAgent either locally or in a cloud hosted environment such as [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-custom-container?tabs=dotnet&pivots=container-linux-vscode).
