# git-story

Attaches the agent sessions that led to a commit to that commit. This package is
the scaffold: a CLI with no story logic yet.

Git runs any `git-<name>` binary on `PATH` as `git <name>`, so the
`git-story` binary is also `git story`.

```text
$ cd ts/packages/git-story
$ pnpm build
$ npm link            # puts git-story on PATH
$ git story init   # registers Copilot CLI hooks for this repo
$ git story hooks copilot user-prompt-submitted
Hello World
```

`init` writes the hooks to `.github/copilot/settings.local.json` and adds that
file to `.git/info/exclude`, so it stays local to the clone.
