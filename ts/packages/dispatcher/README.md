# TypeAgent Dispatcher

TypeAgent Dispatcher is **sample code** and the core component that explores how to build a **single personal assistant** implementation with TypeChat:

- [TypeAgent Shell](../shell) and [TypeAgent CLI](../cli) are two front ends that make use of this shared component.
- Extensible [application agents](../agentSdk/README.md) architecture.
- [Agent Cache](../cache/README.md) to lower latency and cost.

Dispatcher processes user requests and asks LLM to translate it into an action based on a schema provided by the application agents. It has ability to automatically switch between different agents to provide a seamless experience in a extensible and scalable way.

## Usage

User can request actions provided by [application agents](../agentSdk/README.md) using natural language.

For example, in the [CLI](../cli):

```bash
[calendar]ü§ñ> can you setup a meeting between 2-3PM
Generating translation using GPT for 'can you setup a meeting between 2-3PM'
ü§ñ: can you setup a meeting between 2-3PM => addEvent({"event":{"day":"today","timeRange":["14:00","15:00"],"description":"meeting"}}) [9.531s]
Accept? (y/n)
```

More sample action requests:

- `play some music by Bach for me please`.
- `create a grocery list`
- `add milk to the grocery list`

Additional system "commands" are available to provide direct interaction with the system, See the [Commands](#commands) section below.

## Commands

Beyond natural language, users can specify system command with inputs starting with `@`.

### Toggling Dispatcher Agents

Dispatcher agent can be enabled and disabled.

Toggle a specific `<agent>`:

- `@config agent <agent>` _(Enable `<agent>`)_
- `@config agent --off <agent>` or `@config agent -x <agent>` _(Disable `<agent>`)_

Toggle using `*` pattern:

- `@config agent *` (Enable all agents)
- `@config agent *l*` | (Enable agents that has "l" in the name)

Reset to default:

- `@config agent --reset` or `@config agent -r`

Dispatcher agent's schema, action and command can be toggled independently as well, using `@config schema`, `@config action`, `@config command`.

To list all avaiable agents and their status, just the command without any parameters:

### Explainer

Explainer is the step where the dispatcher leverages the cache to ask the GPT to explain the generated translations once the user accepted it. The result is used to create constructions if it is enabled (see below). (Explanation is not generated for translations using constructions if it is enabled).

As part of the exploration, the cache has multiple explainer implementations, which can be changed in the CLI's interactive mode using the command `@config explainer name <explainer>`.

For example, in the [CLI](../cli):

```bash
[üìÖüíäüì©üìùüëÄü™ü‚öõÔ∏èüí¨üîß]> @config explainer name v4

[üìÖüíäüì©üìùüëÄü™ü‚öõÔ∏èüí¨üîß (explainer: v4)]>
```

To list all configured explainers:

```bash
ü§ñüößüíæ  [üìÖüíäüì©üìùüëÄü™ü‚öõÔ∏èüí¨üîß]>@config explainer
Usage: @config explainer name <explainer>
   <explainer>: v4, v5
```

### Shortcut commands

There are other short cut commands to exercise specify part of the TypeAgent Dispatcher system:

- `@translate <request>` - Only do the translation (no follow up explanation )
- `@explain <request> => <action>` - only do the explanation of the request/action combo

### Sessions

TypeAgent dispatcher settings, such as translator, explainer, etc., are stored in sessions, and sessions can be persisted across activation on a per user basis and restored when the app restarts. Use `@session <args>` command to do run operations. Additionally data such as construction store are saved in the sessions as well by default unless an explicit path are provided. The last cache file used is preserved thru reload.

For dispatcher configured to persist sessions (i.e. [CLI](../cli) and [shell](../shell)) the session settings and data are stored in `<home>/.typeagent/profiles/<profile>/sessions/<name>`. (`<home>` is the user profile directory. `~` in Linux, `%USERPROFILE%` in Windows. `<profile>` set for the enlistment, the mapping from enlistment to `<profile>` can be found in `<home>/.typeagent/global.json`).

| Command                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Constructions

Constructions are local parsing and transform rules built based on the explanations given by LLM.
Use the `@const <args>` command at the prompt to control the construction store.

| Command                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@const new [<file>]`     | Initialize the construction store and start saving constructions built using explanations from user prompts. Existing constructions will be removed.<br> If file is not provide, but session is persisted and auto save is on, then it will use a file name generated in the session directory.<br>Otherwise, the cache will be in memory only. Use `@const save` to assign a file name to save to |
| `@const load [<file>]`    | Load a construction store from a file. If the file is not provided, load from the default location for the translation specified in the config. Existing construction will be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `@const auto [on\|off]`   | Toggle auto saving mode. When auto saving mode is on, the construction store will be written on every new construction added to the store. If the session is persisted and auto save mode is turned on, but the construction store is not backed by a file, then a new file name will be generated and save in the session.                                                                        |

## Adding Dispatcher Agent

Addition Dispatcher Agent can be create to extend the capabilities of the **single personal assistant**.

### NPM Module

Go to Agent SDK [README](../agentSdk/README.md) for details on how to create a dispatcher agent in a NPM modules.

Dispatcher currently only supports "static" loading of dispatcher agent. To add a dispatcher agent:

- Add the package in as dependency in the dispatcher's [package.json](./package.json)
- Add a declaration of the module under `agents` in the dispatcher's [config.json](./data/config.json)

```
   "agents": {
      "<agentName>": {
         "type": "module",
         "name": "<packageName>",
      }
   }
```

### Inline dispatcher agent

For internal use only, but an agent can be inlined in the dispatcher. This should only be used for agents that strongly ties to the inner working of the dispatcher (e.g. system configuration, etc.)
