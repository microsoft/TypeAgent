# knowledge-processor

Knowledge-processor is **sample code** that explores _early_ ideas in Structured RAG. See the [knowpro](../knowPro/README.md) package for the latest on Structured RAG.

Knowledge-processor explores how to:

- Extract **_knowledge_**: from conversations, transcripts, images, and documents.
- Index the extracted knowledge and source text for retrieval.
- Generate queries: translate natural language questions into **queries** to retrieve this knowledge.
- Generate answers: use query results to generate natural language **_answer_** questions.

Knowledge-processor is currently used to implement [conversation-memory](./src/conversation/conversationManager.ts) for the Agent Shell.
