# Memory

**Memory** includes sample packages that explore how to implement different memory types using the [KnowPro](../knowPro/README.md) library.

Memory types currently being explored:

- [Conversation memories](./conversation/README.md) are memories that represented
  as sequences of messages. Such memories include chat and conversation transcripts, agent interactions, emails, document parts, etc. Conversation memories are dynamic, mutable and built/indexed incrementally and on demand.
- [Image memory](./image/README.md) in the [image-memory](./image/README.md) package
