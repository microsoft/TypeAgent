# Memory

**Memory** includes sample packages that explore how to implement different memory types using the [KnowPro](../knowPro/README.md) library.

Memory types currently being explored:

- [Conversational memories](./conversation/README.md) in the [conversation-memory](./conversation/) package.
  - [Conversation Memory](./conversation/src/conversationMemory.ts)
  - [Podcast](./conversation/src/podcast.ts)
  - [Email](./conversation/src/emailMemory.ts)
- [Image memory](./image/README.md) in the [image-memory](./image/README.md) package

Look at the [memory example](../../examples/chat/README.md) for example usage.
