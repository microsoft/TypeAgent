# Conversation-memory

The **conversation-memory** package is **experimental sample code** under active development with _frequent_ changes to the API.

Conversation-memory explores how to implement types of _conversational memory_ using the [knowpro](../../knowPro/README.md)/ library.

The following memory types can be considered conversations: sequences of timestamped **messages** between senders and receivers.

- [Conversation Memory](./src/conversationMemory.ts) such as interactive chats
- [Podcasts](./src/podcast.ts)
- [Email](./src/emailMemory.ts)
