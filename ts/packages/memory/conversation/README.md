# Conversation Memory

The **conversation-memory** package is **experimental sample code** under active development with _frequent_ updates.

The **conversation-memory** package explores how to implement types of _conversational memory_ using the [KnowPro](../../knowPro/README.md) library.

A **conversation** is defined as sequences of timestamped **messages** between senders and receivers. The following memory types can be considered conversations:

- [Conversation Memory](./src/conversationMemory.ts) such as interactive chats
- [Podcasts](./src/podcast.ts)
- [Email](./src/emailMemory.ts)

A document is conversation like and defined as a sequence of document parts.

- [Document](./src/docMemory.ts)
