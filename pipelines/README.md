# Azure DevOp pipelines

This folder contains Azure DevOp pipelines for the TypeAgent repo.

## Smoke tests on pull requests from forks

`azure-smoke-tests.yml` needs protected resources (an internal npm feed, the
`MSOCTO-ADO-Service-Connection`, and Key Vault) that Azure Pipelines withholds
from fork builds by default, so a fork PR fails at its first authenticated step
unless secrets are made available to forks. Because this pipeline is sourced
from a GitHub repo, there is no `pull_request_target` / `check-user-permission`
equivalent; the write-access gate is configured in the pipeline UI instead.

Configure it under **Edit pipeline → ⋮ → Triggers → Pull request validation**
(these settings are UI-only and cannot be set in YAML):

| Setting | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forks → Build pull requests from forks of this repository | On | Let fork PRs trigger the pipeline. |
| Forks → Make secrets available to builds of forks | On | Fork builds otherwise can't reach the npm feed, service connection, or Key Vault. |
| Comment triggers → Require a team member's comment before building a pull request | Only for pull requests from non-team members | Nothing runs on a non-write-access contributor's fork PR until a team member (write or admin on the GitHub repo) comments `/azp run`. New commits require a fresh comment. |

The comment gate is the protection: it ensures the secrets-bearing run only
happens after someone with write access reviews and vouches for the fork code.
For defense in depth, optionally add an **Approvals & checks** gate on
`MSOCTO-ADO-Service-Connection`.
