Message 2:
DAVE MISTICH: Joe Manchin has been a fixture in West Virginia politics for decades. And with a 50-50 Senate, he's also become a fixture in debates over Democrats' agenda, including Biden's spending plan. The conservative Democrat has demanded the proposal shrink in size. That's meant entire provisions have been left out, including free community college and paid family leave. His position as a negotiator hasn't set well with some Democrats back home.

Message 3:
HORSLEY: That's right. China is still subject to these tariffs. China is not a big supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States, but it is thought to be really responsible for the global glut in those products that's driven down prices. Russia is still subject to the tariffs, and Japan is still subject.Now, Japan is a relatively significant supplier of steel to the U.S., and of course it's an American ally. But Japan was never given one of those temporary waivers like those other countries, so customers of Japanese steel and aluminum have been seeing a tariff - 25 percent on steel, 10 percent on aluminum - since late March. That was a source of some friction when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was down in Florida meeting with President Trump two weeks ago.Also, South Korea has been given a permanent exemption from the steel tariffs as part of a renegotiated free trade agreement. In exchange, though, South Korea had to agree to cut its steel exports to the U.S. by about 30 percent. And the White House says it's looking to impose similar quotas on some of these other countries.

Message 6:
CHANG: That, of course, is physicist Stephen Hawking, who died earlier this month. That machine voice became Hawking's voice after a debilitating neurological disease took away his own ability to talk. Hawking used to joke about getting stuck with an American accent. But the truth is, the late scientist grew quite attached to it - so attached that he got a group of tech whizzes to take on the painstaking task of rescuing his voice. After nearly 30 years, the 1986 hardware that powered Stephen Hawking's voice was degrading. And one of the engineers who had to figure out how to save it was Eric Dorsey.Hi, Eric.

HILL: There's fear among administrators of hospitals and nursing homes that there'll be staff shortages. Many hospitals, their vaccination rate is 90% - about that.

One hospital is not doing maternity anymore. So Governor Hochul came by yesterday, and she said, I'm prepared to declare a state of emergency that would help fill any gap in staff shortages.

DANIEL ESTRIN: Well, it was a milestone. It held a lot of symbolic meaning. And the Israelis really milked the moment. There was an El Al plane, Israel's flagship airlines, that flew. They decorated the plane with the word peace in Hebrew, Arabic and English. And the headrests on our seats said, making history. I spoke to Israeli flight attendants who said they'd been working for decades for the airlines and that this was the most exciting flight they've ever taken, traveling openly to a newly welcoming Arab country. And then the pilot made a special announcement.

DREISBACH: It's hard to imagine now, but historians have documented how very early on, the Ku Klux Klan adopted almost absurd rituals. Their costumes and titles like dragons and ghouls and goblins were often seen by white officials as outlandish. They didn't take seriously the stories of attacks by hooded men in white sheets. But eventually newspaper reporters and government investigators started documenting how those hooded men were, in fact, committing murder and other atrocities. They pulled back the Klan hood to see the terrorism and violence it masked.Tom Dreisbach, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF ODDISEE SONG, "WANT SOMETHING DONE")

Message 51:
WEINGART: A decade and a half later, in 1963, that was the weakness of the law that a young member of the American Nazi Party targeted. His name was Alexander DeFields. He moved to South Bend, Ind., from Michigan in a strategic move to organize for the American Nazi Party just as the civil rights movement was heating up. That year, he distributed anti-Semitic and racist leaflets for the party on cars outside of a bowling alley. He was later arrested for violating the Indiana anti-hate act. The case had been largely lost to history. Libby Baker and Judy Shroyer of the Michiana Jewish Historical Society came upon the case.

MASKELL: Well, it's incredible the fact that you can, but it's never been tested because there has always been respect for our Parliament. And I think today has been a bad day for British democracy. The people of our country across our constituencies vote for us to hold the government to account, to scrutinize their actions, to ask questions and to debate. And by preventing us on the biggest issue facing Great Britain at this time - it's quite shocking that the prime minister is not wanting to be held to account and seek the counsel of his peers.

ROSENTHAL: You know, the first thing is always ask for an itemized bill. And if you see something that doesn't make sense, like this $5,000 charge that was listed as anesthesia - you know, she said, whoa, what's that about? Asking those questions got the charge dropped for her to about $500. So for me, the takeaway is, you know, we tend to look at these bills and go, whoa, what's that, I don't know - ask, make a fuss. It may make a difference, both for you and for your insurer.

BONDY: Well, I think Canada was clear all along that if it didn't agree with what was on the table, if it was not the right deal, that it was not going to sign at any cost. It seems to me that this date of Friday was something that was manufactured by the U.S. administration in an attempt to meet the deadlines for congressional approval and in relation to the Mexican president's stepping down and being replaced and so kind of trying to push a deal through. Canada said all along what matters is getting the right deal and that if we don't have that on the table, we'll keep talking. That's in effect what's happened.

Message 73:
BODETTE: So that's incredibly meaningful because, you know, again, women are far from the only oppressed group under the current Iranian state, but they're the first and the largest one. And the dress codes that these women are protesting are just the tip of the iceberg. Iranian law grants men, government an incredible degree of power and control over really the most intimate and personal aspect of women's lives, from marriage and divorce and inheritance to travel, work and legal cases.And notably, this is not the first time that Iranian women have courageously resisted these discriminatory practices. But it is the first time that these feminist demands, these demands for the basic equality of women, have sparked such a sustained, nationwide protest against dictatorship as a whole. Because all women in Iran face this severe oppression, their demands unify people across these religious and ethnic lines. And because gender inequality is so foundational to the state and its repressive institutions, a demand for women's freedom is naturally, I would say, a demand for the democracy and freedom from all the kinds of human rights abuses that women and men alike suffer from there.

ROSE: Well, exactly. This is very unusual. The public and reporters are rarely allowed into these places. But the allegations here are so serious that the Border Patrol says they have to defend themselves. I mean, understand these allegations have made headlines for days. The head of Customs and Border Protection announced his resignation after the story broke. Even President Trump and Vice President Pence have been expressing concern for the migrant kids held here. So while CBP denied the allegations, it became sort of a he said, she said story. And reporters were asking who they should believe, and they asked to see the facility for themselves. Yesterday, CBP said they didn't have time to take anyone on a tour, that they needed all hands on deck to process the, you know, influx of migrants crossing the border. But today, apparently, they changed their mind.

Message 90:
OTIS: Latin American diplomats are saying that they're open to things like tougher sanctions. Pence wants them to, for example, restrict visas to Maduro officials, to confiscate state oil company assets in their countries, to close off their banking systems. But even before today's meetings, Latin American leaders - including the vice president of Brazil - were explicitly ruling out military intervention in Venezuela.You know, right now there's a lot of unity in many parts of the world in terms of backing Guaido and isolating Maduro. And so there's a danger that this solidarity could break apart if there's a major push, either from within the Venezuelan opposition or the U.S. - or from some other country - to send in troops.

MCLAUGHLIN: Right. It appears that they've been targeting both campaigns. It doesn't appear that they got into Biden or Harris' campaigns. They had more success, though, with Trump campaign emails. They've allegedly been sharing some of what they stole with journalists, including research on Trump's running mate, JD Vance, and also, most recently, the September letter from Trump's lawyer to The New York Times.Actually, today is the first time we've seen a journalist publish the Vance dossier in full. It was on an independent Substack, and the argument was that it sheds light on the Trump campaign's perceptions of Vance's weaknesses, and, you know, the public deserves to know. Though, the blogger, Ken Klippenstein, conceded that the information in the document is pretty much public already.

SANDERS: Well, no. That wasn't my intention in resigning. I resigned just because personally, I couldn't continue to serve this administration with this executive order in place. That was it - just a matter of personal conscience. I'm not sure our citizens understand the role of the career civil service. I happen to think it's a national treasure. I happen to think it's the best in the world. It's absolutely critical because of the complexity of that world - the laws, the rules, the regulations, the scientific theories, all of the things that go into public policy. Somebody has to understand that you can't look at the CliffNotes (ph) and get it.

Message 118:
FOER: Well, what I had was this tiny photo that my mother had kept that had my father and, my mother said, the people that she understood had saved him. And it was actually the very same photo that I gave our middle son, Jonathan Foer, when he went to Ukraine and ended up writing a novel, "Everything Is Illuminated." But ultimately, because he wrote that novel, and it became a best-seller and a movie, people started to come to me, and they'd go, well, that's not true. That's not what really happened.And I kept talking to these people and saying, well, did you know my father, Louis Safran? And there were - no, they didn't because in these small towns - well, first of all, it was only recently that people in Eastern Europe in these villages had last names. But they were called by their nickname. And finally, somebody said to me, oh, you mean Labald (ph) from Liescht (ph)?And it was those kinds of small pieces that I was - I felt like a real detective. And ultimately, as you'll see in the book, I hired an FBI agent to analyze the photographs of the people that somebody in Ukraine had sent me of the family they thought hid my father and the picture that my mother had that had survived all those years. And this FBI agent, who is one of the world's leading forensic photographic experts, said, you know, I can't tell you it's them. And he said, but I can't tell you it's not them.And ultimately, he gave me a very important clue. He said, when you go to Ukraine, look at the clothes that people are wearing in photographs. These people didn't have huge wardrobes. And if you could find them wearing the same clothes, that'll be a good sign of identification. And he was absolutely right.

Message 120:
STOCKMAN: The original leaders who spearheaded this movement were a diverse coalition. And one among them is a Jewish woman who says that she felt uncomfortable in the movement as a Jewish woman. She was eventually pushed out. And part of the reason she felt uncomfortable is that a black woman and a Latina woman who were among these original leaders were associating with the Nation of Islam. So she found that to be very problematic because Louis Farrakhan is widely seen as anti-Semitic in the Jewish community.

And of course that's at the center of what's happening today. Over the past two months, I've seen marches for Black trans lives. We've had movement around Black victims of intimate partner violence. There are actions happening here almost every day, not all of which are focused around the Justice Center and the federal courthouse because there is movement building that's happening from youth to elders among Black, Indigenous and other people of color here, as well as allies and accomplices.

Message 134:
SNELL: Caforio knocked on doors this weekend in a heavily Hispanic area of the high desert city of Palmdale. He's hoping that his personal touch and progressive politics like a pathway to citizenship without compromises will help bring Democrats to the polls. His opponent Katie Hill takes a much more moderate approach. She's in line with party leaders in Washington who want to trade some border security money for DACA protections. And she argues it's the right way to win votes in moderate suburban districts like this.

LUCAS: There was a lot in here. But at one point - actually over the course of the hearing, really, Democrats took aim at Maguire. They accused him of blocking the complaint from being provided to Congress. There was even the suggestion that he had perhaps done so at the direction of the White House. Now, Maguire denied that he had held this back. He said flat-out the White House had not directed him to withhold it from lawmakers. He said that this whole situation is unprinted - is unprecedented. And it's unprecedented because it involves the president's own communications with a foreign leader. And those communications are covered by executive privilege.He says he was required by law to work through that with the White House and the Justice Department, and he said that that took time. Now, on the whistleblower, he said the president has not asked him to find out the individual's identity. And Maguire made clear time and again over the course of this hearing that he supports and wants to protect the whistleblower. This is a bit of what he said. Let's hear a listen.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

Message 139:
LUPKIN: But the standard contracting process can take months or years. So the government allowed an alternative called an other transaction agreement, or OTA. This approach was intended to attract companies that otherwise wouldn't be willing to contract with the federal government. But these alternative agreements come with a risk for the government and taxpayers. They don't include some standard protections. Typical contracts would allow the government to take control of a drug or vaccine if, for example, the drugmaker engages in price gouging. Leaving that out worries people like Kathryn Ardizzone, a lawyer at Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit focused on intellectual property policy.

SHAPIRO: In 2014, the state switched Flint's water supply in an effort to save money. Water from the Flint River came out of people's taps looking brown and smelling like sewage. Government leaders at all levels told people the water was safe. It wasn't. The improperly treated water corroded old pipes that leached lead into faucets and showers. Kids were poisoned with lead.The state provided free bottled water for two years, until April. And now, after switching back to the original water supply, the state once again says the tap water is safe to drink. Companies and charities donated these pallets of bottled water. Miss K says there isn't enough for everybody who lines up to get some.

Will I be on the front lines of all the threats that I eventually was on the front lines of? So I think that's a lot of what played into it.

MAK: You're right. The resolution can't force a change in President Trump's policy regarding Syria or Afghanistan, but 43 Republicans out of 53 total in the Senate voted to rebuke him on his Syria policy today. It signals to the president that many members of his own party are not with him when it comes to a swift withdrawal and disagree with his belief that ISIS has been defeated. Here's what Trump said in a video message he posted on Twitter back in December.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

Now, the Chinese government has threatened critics overseas for years. But what intrigued me was there was this new tactic that Wang said he'd been hit with. And what was happening is somebody was calling in bomb threats in Wang's name to Chinese embassies and hotels, trying to get him arrested.

If you stand on the street, you can look through the top floor windows straight up to the clear, blue sky - no roof. So how do you start pulling objects out of a fire-ravaged building? It takes a lot of coordination between city workers and emergency responders strung across each floor. City Records Commissioner Pauline Toole explained it works a bit like an assembly line.

VALI NASR: It's not going to be easy. In other words, the U.S. could use military option against Iran, but it will not necessarily kill the program. And in fact, it will then push Iran to make the very decision that Rob Malley said Iran has not made yet, which is to acquire nuclear weapons. So the United States then would really have to contemplate continuing a war with Iran until it takes nuclear weapons away from Iran, which means a kind of military presence in the region that the United States does not want to contemplate and may not be successful at doing it.

When she landed, her custom wheelchair was not there. The airline had left it behind. She did not get it back for more than 10 hours, which meant, as she wrote on Twitter, that she was essentially legless during that time, that a piece of her was missing and that she'd suddenly lost her independence.Kristen Parisi, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

ABREVAYA: Absolutely. And I think one of the reasons why spouses or caregivers feel so desperate to connect with one another is because, unfortunately, caregivers have been made to feel that they cannot say how hellish it is because they think that that is a commentary on their loved one and their desire for that loved one to survive.And so while this may be a phrase that others authentically feel, I feel the phrase, it's an honor to care for you, or it's my greatest joy to care for you, are phrases that are thrust on me as a caregiver that feel so out of place. And so what I say to Brian is, this is hell, and I still love you. And I will still fight like hell. And I wish that caregivers didn't feel like the only other people they can share that secret with is each other.

GOFF: So you asked a tricky question because I think it depends on what your definition of policing is and your definition of better. I have seen departments professionalize and drive down racial disparities, and I have seen that the number of folks who police kill has stayed constant for the seven years, eight years that we've been collecting the data publicly and for my 15 years of doing the analysis.Policing is set up to do a set of things. It does that with ruthless efficiency. It is not set up ideally for community safety because, to do that, you need to do investment. And so there are people who would say policing hasn't gotten better, but it hasn't gotten worse because it continues to do those things efficiently. And in there, I talk about both activists and the chiefs with whom I work.

MISDARY: Greenpoint and neighboring Williamsburg are among several waterfront areas in New York City that face severe threats from storm surge and sea level rise. At the same time, they're booming with development. The local community board estimates 20 towers are in the works, between 30 and 40 stories each, with median home prices over $1,000,000. The lure of seeing the Manhattan skyline across the river and lavish amenities come with shortfalls for residents, according to local city council member Lincoln Restler.

PARKS: The answer is probably yes, unless you're in one of those handful of states that allows for you to have your ballot just postmarked by Election Day and not actually to election officials on Election Day. The Postal Service has said for months that for voters to be sure those ballots are counted, they need to be mailed a week or more in advance of any deadlines. So now the messaging from local election officials is kind of shifting from, you know, mail those ballots in to don't mail those ballots in. Find a way to vote in person. Most states allow for voters to turn in that mail ballot in person in some way, whether it's dropping it off at a secure drop box, dropping it off at an elections office or a polling precinct or just voting in person on Election Day instead. Voters should just check their local rules depending on where they live.

Ali Ellebedy is an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis. He says these antibodies will offer long-term sustaining protection against severe COVID. Why? Well, he and his colleagues have just completed studies revealing something surprising and critical about the cells that create these antibodies. Several months after the vaccine, they migrate into the bone marrow and stay there.

Message 251:
FLORIDO: Well, this is a study that was commissioned by Puerto Rico's own government. If you remember shortly after the storm, the government started getting a lot of criticism for not taking its death count seriously - beginning with that famous visit from President Trump, when he touted that there'd only been 16 deaths certified. Puerto Rico's government stopped counting at 64. And a lot of media outlets and other researchers started trying to arrive at their own numbers. And so this issue kept getting more and more controversial. And finally in February, Puerto Rico's Governor Ricardo Rossello announced that he would ask researchers from George Washington University to start looking into it and arrive at their own number. And that's when they started working on this study that they released today.

HIRSH NAFTALI: Well, it's interesting because we were watching the news, but it was unknown. So the first thing - we were waiting to see Abigail. That was the most important thing - to understand that she was truly released. The second thing that he talked about, which for me was really important - it's what Noa and I are very focused on right now - is that he and his administration, along with Qatar and Egypt, the leaders in those countries - that they would continue to work with the Israelis to make sure that more hostages will be released and that we will not stop, from the top level down to what we're doing on our - let's call it on our local level - to make sure that every hostage comes home to their loved ones.And I'll say this, which is the one piece that I listened when I heard him speak so beautifully was that what he really wanted to do was give this little girl a hug. That's what I think so many people have said to us - that they just want her to come home, and they just want to embrace her because Abigail coming home is like any of our children, grandchildren. This is the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief. And the most poignant moment was when he said, I just want to give this child a hug.

Message 270:
THOMPSON: "Moon Music," Coldplay's 10th studio album, is its fifth to hit No. 1 but its first in a decade. That chart performance was fueled almost entirely by an old-fashioned metric, album sales, which accounted for nearly 90% of the band's 120,000 equivalent album units. That's Billboard speak for the cocktail of sales, airplay and streaming that goes into ranking the performance of albums on any given week's Billboard 200 chart.Some of that success was aided by high-profile TV appearances on "SNL" and elsewhere, but newfangled tricks helped too. The album was available in no fewer than eight different vinyl editions, including two signed versions and a Target exclusive edition with three extra tracks. Plus there were six different CD editions and four different discounted download editions, including two that include scads of bonus tracks.Pick your metaphor - they pulled out all the stops; they left it all on the field; they made fetch happen. Still, with no blockbuster hits and not a ton of streaming or radio airplay, it seems doubtful that "Moon Music" will hold on to the top spot for long.

LICCARDO: You know, all too often, I would have conversations with folks who were perhaps much more conservative than me. And we'd be talking about this, and I'd say, hey, you know what? This isn't actually governmental regulation. This is private sector regulation. This is insurance companies. Insurance companies have been regulating safety of automobiles for five decades, and as a result, we all have seen per mile deaths drop dramatically over the last five decades because we have air bags and anti-lock brakes and so forth that insurance companies incentivize drivers to go buy. And when they start to hear more, we are seeing that folks understand it. They get it. This is not about Big Brother. This is not about us taking anyone's gun away. This is about using creative alternative ways, including private sector and nonprofit sector, getting them involved and helping us to solve a problem in the same way that we solve other public health problems and focusing on reducing the harm, not in engaging in the divisive battles.

JOHNSON: ATF is a small agency, with fewer than 50 agents in New York City, where the city's own police force numbers 36,000. That means partnerships with state and local law enforcement are important. Dettelbach just hired the former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police to help boost those relationships. ATF can offer local police more intelligence about guns used in crimes.

MCCAMMON: In 2015 alone, more than a million people sought asylum in Europe. Thousands have not survived the trip. In our hemisphere, hundreds of thousands of Central Americans, many of them children, have headed to the United States. NPR's Carrie Kahn is based in Mexico and covers Central America and the Caribbean. By mid-decade, she began to notice that it wasn't just Central Americans trekking north. Carrie joins me now to share some of the human stories behind the statistics. Hi, Carrie.

KARPF: I would agree that Twitter is often not great for humanity, but I don't think this is a great example of it.

Message 342:
KELLEY: It's incredibly heartbreaking because Southwest Florida is truly a gem. I mean, it was filled with so much wildlife. I - you know, I don't know if there's even a bird that's going to be alive here. I've been talking to people, and they're saying that they're gone, that there's - you don't even hear a bird chirping anymore. You know, half of Sanibel was a wildlife refuge - the largest one, J.N. "Ding" Darling. And it was wonderful because they couldn't develop. And, you know, Sanibel was only a 16-square-mile island, but the people were pioneers that were here. And the people that are here now are going to have to be because the causeway is gone. You know, the causeway was built in 1963, and before that, the old pioneers would have to take a ferry back and forth to the island.

ZIENER: I think there's three main issues. The one is security. The other one is economics, and then it's right-wing populism. And it all has to do with the fact that we already know what it means if Donald Trump is president because we already had one term with him, and we remember that it was very difficult in particular for the Germans to deal with Donald Trump at the time. It looked at if he had singled out Germany as an adversary, as an enemy, particular when we talk about security and how much Germany is spending on defense. He was criticizing Germany time and again for not doing enough. By the way, I think he had a point in doing so at the time.

Message 350:
CARRIERE: Well, I was estranged from him for 12 years because he did transgress in many ways. There was an oversharing of information that was often inflected with sexuality, and he put me in dangerous situations. But then I was subjected to a similar indoctrination to what my mother was subjected to. An overzealous clinician implanted false memories of ritualized sexual abuse and murder into her. And I went to a treatment center where I was told that my father had molested me, that he was a monster and I should never speak to him again.And I didn't speak to him for 12 years. And then after a massive dissociative episode in 2018 that dissolved my entire identity yet again, I needed to rebuild myself from the raw materials of my life. And my mother was suffering from dementia. The nanny who raised me was dead. He was the only one left. And I went, and I confronted my father. And I told him everything. I told him all the ways I felt that he had violated boundaries. And it was an extraordinary reunion that helped me understand how so many things can be true and how to humanize. So I told him everything.

LUCAS: Exactly. And remember, Manafort spent about six months with the Trump campaign. Manafort's people have said that he doesn't have anything to offer. But we know that he attended that infamous Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016 when a Russian lawyer came offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner were also at that meeting. And there are now reports that Trump himself knew about the meeting ahead of time. So there are likely things that Manafort knows that would be of interest to Robert Mueller.

SHAPIRO: The lyrics of the song are really powerful. It describes a leader arriving and saying, tell me your grievances with sincerity and frankness, and have no fear. So my friend Hassan spoke up and said, your excellency, where's the bread and where's the milk and the guaranteed housing? And the enlightened leader says, thank you for your honesty. You will be rewarded. And one year later, the leader returns and asks the same question. And then the lyric says, no one dared, so I said, where's the bread and where's the milk and the guaranteed housing? And pardon me, oh, excellency, where is my friend Hassan?

Message 369:
ROH: It's a tricky question because, essentially, a peace declaration is obviously very different than a peace treaty - for three reasons. A peace declaration is really a statement that, you know, we are going to end hostile relations that have existed between belligerent parties - as opposed to a peace treaty, which would actually legally and formally end the Korean War. And second thing is a peace declaration in itself is not binding; it's a political declaration. And finally - this is, I think, an important point that you alluded to - a peace declaration would really be purely a bilateral statement between North Korea and United States, whereas in the case of a peace treaty, because of the different parties involved, this would necessitate a multilateral treaty - basically meaning China, South Korea, North Korea and the United States. So it's two very, very different things with different intended purposes.

Message 370:
COLLINS: So in a way, the government was sending a message by even filing charges against these officers. None of these three were, after all, accused of killing George Floyd. And it's probably too early to tell.But people who follow these issues of policing closely say this may be a broader message to police departments across the country as they tweak their trainings and policies to be sure that officers on the scene know they have a responsibility for what happens to people in their custody and to even intervene physically with a colleague if it's necessary to save someone's life. And then secondly, these three defendants are also charged in Minnesota state court with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. And these guilty verdicts in federal court may incentivize these defendants to work on plea deals on those state charges.

Message 375:
ARAL: So when it comes to labeling of fake news, it's incredibly effective because, A, it creates in the user a critical reflection. And that has been shown in experimental studies when we're reflective about what we're reading, then we are much less likely to believe false news and much less likely to spread it. So labeling with algorithms, human moderators and the crowd together could be very effective. But it has to scale because if you don't label a sufficient number of things, the things that aren't labeled, consumers assume that they are true. That's the implied truth effect.And so you can't just have a labeling solution. You have to have a labeling solution that scales. And we've actually done this relatively well in user ratings and reviews ferreting out false and fraudulent ratings and reviews, as well as sort of policing that entire system through Amazon, other commercial entities, Reddit, Yelp and so on. And I can imagine a labeling system that does work. The point of the book is that it has to be rigorous and nuanced.

YGLESIAS: I will defend President Trump's inclination to get the United States out of some of these wars - against David's attacks. But the question on all this is, you know, is there real thought or strategy, or is there just impulses? He's been picking, you know, fights with the military about this Navy SEAL and these war crimes accusations. And, you know, a president needs to have some focus on something complicated, like disengaging from an 18-year-long war, and that just doesn't seem like the kind of thing President Trump really does.

STEWART: Yeah, and I - and you would have to ask them. But the format downstairs in our committee is very, very different. Again, it's not five minutes. And it's not in front of TV cameras. And that's the big difference. And so we have an hour each, and we - and then, again, another shared hour. We can really follow a line of questioning. It's a very different experience. And you can have - you can expose so much more information in our process than you can in these open hearings in front of cameras in five-minute blocks.

EYDER PERALTA: November 18 was a historic day in Zimbabwe. After 38 years of a brutal repression, thousands of people shed their fears and poured onto the streets to call for the ouster of Robert Mugabe. And, as local news footage shows, in the middle of the capital city, they began to dance to a song by pop star Jah Prayzah. The chorus is full of promises - a hero, it says, is coming, and everything will be different.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "KUTONGA KWARO")

SELYUKH: Been a long day. It's been a long day. It's really buzzing. I found the quietest corner, and yet here I am. There's definitely a steady stream of little children lining up for pictures with Santa, if that tells you anything. Last year, that involved a plexiglass shield. This year, it's, you know, all masks off and smiles for the camera. Security is circling around, reminding folks to wear masks. And for many people, this is their first Black Friday in-person since before the pandemic began. Stephanie Holland (ph) came to the mall for some pajamas and jewelry gifts.

Message 396:
REED: I did. You know, not only substantively does it put millions of Americans in harm's way if the court agrees with the Justice Department that the whole law needs to be ruled unconstitutional. I think politically, you know, to not have a concrete proposal, a concrete plan on the Republican side that we could roll out with the votes, with Democrat, Republican support to get to the president's desk and signed into law is risky. It puts a lot of people, rightfully so, in an anxious position. And politically that causes us to probably be in a weaker position in my political opinion. Now, that's just my opinion. But, you know, that's why I disagree with this both on political and substantive basis.

Message 406:
WILENSKY: Perez's complex escaped Sandy, but with another few decades of sea level rise, a similar storm could bring floodwaters right to its doors. A WNYC/NPR analysis of exclusive data from the National Hurricane Center shows that a Sandy-like storm could flood more than 50 NYCHA developments by 2080. That's nearly 50% more than were inundated by the original superstorm in 2012. Nationally, another estimate projects three times as many low-income homes at risk of frequent flooding by 2050. Bernice Rosenzweig is a professor of environmental studies at Sarah Lawrence College.

Message 418:
RISSETTO: Sure. I always was interested in science and medicine. And, you know, I went to college. I studied history. And, you know, obviously, in college, a lot of people gain weight, so I gained weight. And I had never had a problem with weight before. I lost a lot of weight on my own, but then I just thought to myself, I should just go to a dietician to understand more.So I went to a dietitian, who happens to be white, and she just explained everything to me in a very, you know, real, scientific way - like, you know, made it "digestible," quote-unquote, for me to understand. And it was great. And I had success. And I thought, wow, that's so interesting.And then I thought, I wonder if there are other dietitians that aren't white women, right? Like, where are they? And it was really hard to find. And then it just led me to think, well, I'm really interested in medicine, science. I'm interested in nutrition. So let me go back to school to become a registered dietitian. And in my classes, you know, it was that makeup, right? It was all white women who were studying dietetics for whatever reason. And I thought that that was really significant because people need to see more people that look like them so that they can feel heard and, you know, somebody relates to them and understands. And not that my counterparts aren't culturally competent. I don't want to say that they aren't because many, many, many of them are. But many of them are, you know, in their own little bubble. And they have their own little private practice, and they target a specific clientele. So it really makes nutrition seem something for the elite and not for everybody.

LANGFITT: Well, I mean, honestly Ailsa, it's the future of the U.K. I mean, this is the biggest decision made in this country in decades. The political turmoil - most people would say we haven't seen this in this country since the end of World War II. At a more micro level, it's - does the U.K. leave the EU in an orderly manner? Or does it crash out? - which will damage the EU economy but the U.K.'s a lot more. The other thing is if the U.K. crashes out, it could force the building of a hard border on the island of Ireland. That could actually foment violence. So the stakes are very, very high.I mean, a lot of people right now today are saying the big question is even the future of British democracy. Boris Johnson could try to push the U.K. out of the EU with no deal. The majority of Parliament is against that. I think most people here in the United Kingdom are against that, and yet this could happen. And if that does happen, a question will be, you know, to what degree does this system really work?

Message 462:
MAK: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on the other hand, said in a statement that the Senate should not have had to expand on the House's investigation and that new witnesses are not needed because the House impeachment managers have argued repeatedly that their evidence is already overwhelming.There does not remain much more uncertainty about the outcome of the trial at this point. For the past two weeks, the question was not whether the president will be convicted and removed. Remember that that would take 67 votes, and there's never really been any indication of a large-scale Republican defection. The question was about whether the trial would involve additional witnesses. And with that question settled, we can expect the president's acquittal next Wednesday.

Message 468:
AUERBACH: Well, there were different times, I think, where, you know, he has tried to lead an organization to certain points. And it's a membership organization, so you need buy-ins. So whether or not that was related to cost-of-attendance stipends that help bring athlete scholarships basically up to the full cost of attendance that other scholarships bring regular students on campus - I mean, he has pushed for different things over the years. But I think, you know, we saw overreach in terms of sanctions in response to Penn State. We have seen, you know, kind of him put his foot in his mouth on a number of different issues.He's talked a lot about existential crises facing college sports, and he's used that term so many different times I think it's lost a little bit of its bite. But I think the legal strategy in relation to the Alston case, which was - ended up going all the way up the Supreme Court. And again, just the lack of leadership in getting people behind and working together on various issues to get out in front on the name, image and likeness issue - those are things that people have constantly talked about, and it's just gotten worse and worse, again, as we've seen how unregulated it is.

LOPEZ: So in baseball, it's about a 4% edge relative to, say, a 50/50 game. If you took two teams that were relatively evenly matched, paired them up at where one of the teams was a home team, that home team is going to win about 54% of the time. And if you were to contrast that to other sports, say, like the NBA, you could take two NBA teams that were roughly the same in terms of talent, put one of them at home, and that home team is going to win about 62% of the time.

REEVES: In some cases here - very significantly, I think - they are succeeding. We have seen, in Ecuador, the government backed down on its plans to cut fuel subsidies, the thing that triggered the protests there. In Chile, the president, Sebastian Pinera, has made a number of concessions, and Congress there has agreed to rewrite the Constitution. And while people are communicating with each other across the Internet and seeing protests in other places succeed, I think that increases the likelihood that protests in the region will continue for that reason - because they're delivering results.

BARHAM: It's for my mom. I lost my mom on New Year's Eve of 2019. That holiday will always be marred by the loss of my mother. My mom was, you know, one of my best friends. Every good quality that I have came from that woman, so losing her was extremely hard. And I think that's why, when I talk about this song, this was one of the hardest songs for me to write on the record, in a record full of hard songs to write. It doesn't really sink in that you've lost someone of that much importance until the first holiday rolls around that you associate with that person. For me, it was my birthday, which is early May. So right around Mother's Day, we shared that holiday together. And so for me, that's when it became very real. It crushed me. And that's what that first verse is. The second verse is the day it hit my dad, which was their anniversary.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE FIRST YEAR")
