GUIDO: Welcome to my podcast, Steve and Umesh.
UMESH: What are we going to talk about?
STEVE: Mostly about multi-agent frameworks,
but also about answering questions about podcast transcripts.

Do you have additional topics you'd like to propose?

 GUIDO VAN ROSSUM : Can we also talk about code searching?

UMESH:
I'd like to at least briefly mention email indexing and querying.
