00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.000


00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000


00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:10.559
<v Mr A>Oh, good! That'll be the vet, dear.</v>
<v Mrs B>I'd better go and let him in.</v>

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Mrs B>It's the vet, dear.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.500
<v Mr A>Oh, very glad indeed you could come 'round, sir.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.590
<v Vet>Not at all.
Now, what seems to be the problem?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.149
<v Vet>You can tell me... I'm a vet, you know.</v>
<v Mrs B>See? Tell him, dear.</v>
<v Mr A>Well...</v>
<v Mrs B>It's our cat.</v>

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Mrs B>He doesn't do anything.
He just sits out all day on the lawn.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Vet>Is he... dead?

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Mr A>Oh, no!

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.089
<v Vet>Thank God for that!
For one ghastly moment, I thought I was...

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.110
<v Vet>...too late.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Vet>If only more people would call in the nick of time!

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.829
<v Mrs B>He just sits there, all day and every day.</v>
<v Mr A>And at night.</v>
<v Mrs B>Shh! Almost motionless.</v>

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.759
<v Mrs B>We have to take his food out to him.</v>
<v Mr A>And his milk.</v>
<v Mrs B>Shh!</v>

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Mrs B>He doesn't do anything. He just sits there.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.829
<v Vet>Are you at your wits' end?

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.809
<v Mrs B>Definitely... Shh!... yes.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.419
<v Vet>Hmm. I see.
Well, I think I may be able to help you.
You see...

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.789
<v Vet>Your cat is suffering from what we vets haven't found a word for.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.919
<v Vet>His condition is typified by total physical inertia.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Vet>Absence of interest in its ambience.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Vet>What we vets call "environment."

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.220
<v Vet>Failure to respond to the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.539
<v Vet>conventional external stimuli.
A ball of string, a nice

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Vet>juicy mouse, a bird!

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.590
<v Vet>To be blunt, your cat is in a rut!

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.770
<v Vet>It's the old...

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.699
<v Vet>...Stockbroker syndrome.
The suburban fin de siecle ennui.
Angst, weltschmertz, call it what you will.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.969
<v Mrs B>Moping.</v>
<v Vet>In a way, in a way.
Hmm, moping. I must remember that!
Now...</v>

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Vet>What's to be done?
Tell me sir, have you confused your cat recently ?<v>
<v Mr A>Well, we...</v>

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.199
<v Mrs B>Shh! No.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Vet>Yes, well, I think I can definitely say that your cat badly needs to be confused.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Mrs B>What?</v>
<v Mr A>Shh!</v>

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Mr A>What?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.800
<v Vet>Confused. To shake it out of his state of complacency.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.540
<v Vet>I'm afraid... I'm not personally qualified to confuse cats, but I can recommend an extremely good service.
Here is their card.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.400
<v Mrs B>Oh... Confuse-A-Cat, Limited.
Oh!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.049
<v Sergeant>Squad! Eyes front!

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Sergeant>Cat confusers... Confusers... Hut!

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:18.140
<v General>Well, men, we've got a pretty difficult cat to confuse today, so let's get straight on with it.
Jolly good. Thank you, sergeant.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.349
<v Sergeant>Confusers, get into the van and fetch out...
Wait for it!

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.369
<v Sergeant>Fetch out the funny things!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
<v Sergeant>Move, move, move, move!

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.500
<v Sergeant>One, two, one, two, get those funny things off!

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.000
<v Sergeant>Stage ready for confusing, sir!

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.200
<v General>Very good. Carry on, sergeant.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.600
<v Sergeant>Left turn, double march!

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.500
<v General>Right, men. Confuse the... cat!

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.199
<v Long John Silver>Lords, ladies and gentlemen...

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:21.788
<v General>I hope to God it works.
Anyway, we shall know any minute now.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.720
<v Mrs B>Oh, I can't believe it!</v>
<v Mr A>Neither can I.  It's just like the old days.</v>
<v Mrs B>Then he's cured! Oh, thank you, General!</v>

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Mr A>What can we ever do to repay you ?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.590
<v General>No need to, sir.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.460
<v General>It's all in a day's work for...

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:50.879
<v General>Confuse-A-Cat.
