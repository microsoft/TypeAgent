00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.000
 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:10.559
Oh, good! That'll be the vet, dear.
I'd better go and let him in.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.900
It's the vet, dear.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.500
Oh, very glad indeed you could come 'round, sir.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.590
Not at all. 
Now, what seems to be the problem?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.149
You can tell me... I'm a vet, you know. 
See? Tell him, dear. 
Well...
It's our cat.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.000
He doesn't do anything. 
He just sits out all day on the lawn.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.280
Is he... dead?

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.950
Oh, no!

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.089
Thank God for that! 
For one ghastly moment, I thought I was...

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.110
...too late.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.040
If only more people would call in the nick of time!

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.829
He just sits there, all day and every day.
And at night.
Shh! Almost motionless.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.759
We have to take his food out to him. 
And his milk.
Shh!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.100
He doesn't do anything. He just sits there.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.829
Are you at your wits' end?

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.809
Definitely... Shh!... yes.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.419
Hmm. I see. 
Well, I think I may be able to help you.
You see...

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.789
Your cat is suffering from what we vets haven't found a word for.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.919
His condition is typified by total physical inertia.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.900
Absence of interest in its ambience.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.220
What we vets call "environment."

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.220
Failure to respond to the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.539
conventional external stimuli.
A ball of string, a nice

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.360
juicy mouse, a bird!

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.590
To be blunt, your cat is in a rut!

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.770
It's the old...

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.699
...Stockbroker syndrome. 
The suburban fin de siecle ennui. 
Angst, weltschmertz, call it what you will.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.969
Moping.
In a way, in a way.
Hmm, moping. I must remember that!
Now...

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.500
What's to be done? 
Tell me sir, have you confused your cat recently ?
Well, we...

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.199
Shh! No.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.400
Yes, well, I think I can definitely say that your cat badly needs to be confused.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.000
What?
Shh!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.800
Confused. To shake it out of his state of complacency.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.540
I'm afraid... I'm not personally qualified to confuse cats, but I can recommend an extremely good service. 
Here is their card.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.400
Oh... Confuse-A-Cat, Limited.
Oh!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.049
Squad! Eyes front!

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.000
Cat confusers... Confusers... Hut!

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:18.140
Well, men, we've got a pretty difficult cat to confuse today, so let's get straight on with it. 
Jolly good. Thank you, sergeant.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.349
Confusers, get into the van and fetch out...
Wait for it!

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.369
Fetch out the funny things!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Move, move, move, move!

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.500
One, two, one, two, get those funny things off!

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.000
Stage ready for confusing, sir!

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.200
Very good. Carry on, sergeant.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.600
Left turn, double march!

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.500
Right, men. Confuse the... cat!

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.199
Lords, ladies and gentlemen...

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:21.788
I hope to God it works. 
Anyway, we shall know any minute now.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.720
Oh, I can't believe it!
Neither can I.  It's just like the old days.
Then he's cured! Oh, thank you, General!

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.080
What can we ever do to repay you ?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.590
No need to, sir.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.460
It's all in a day's work for...

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:50.879
Confuse-A-Cat.
