## Test coverage

## Analysis of Uncovered Code in semrefindex.py
Based on the coverage report, here are the main areas of semrefindex.py that are currently uncovered:

üîç Major Uncovered Areas:
Knowledge Extraction Pipeline (lines 81-102)

process_semantic_refs_batch() function
Batch processing of text through knowledge extractor
Error handling for knowledge extraction failures
Entity Processing (lines 173-197)

add_entity() function - detailed entity processing
Adding entity types and facets as separate terms
add_facet() function for processing entity facets
Action Processing (lines 277-341)

add_action() function - comprehensive action processing
Handling verbs, subject/object entities, parameters
Complex parameter processing (string vs object params)
Subject entity facet processing
Knowledge Integration (lines 369-409)

add_knowledge_to_semantic_ref_index() function
Validation and integration of entities, actions, topics
Inverse action processing
Serialization/Deserialization (lines 508-521, 579, 616-621)

TermToSemanticRefIndex serialization methods
Data persistence functionality
Advanced Index Operations (lines 468-474, 531, 551)

Complex term preparation and scoring
Advanced term lookup and removal operations
Conversation Building (lines 631, 645-647)

build_conversation_index() function
build_semantic_ref_index() function
Auto knowledge extraction settings
Utility Functions (lines 673-680)

dump() function for debugging/inspection
üéØ Coverage Improvement Opportunities:
To increase coverage, we would need tests that:

Test knowledge extraction pipeline with actual knowledge extractor
Test complex entity processing with facets and multiple types
Test action processing with all parameter types and edge cases
Test serialization/deserialization of populated indexes
Test conversation building end-to-end scenarios
Test error handling in knowledge extraction failures
Test utility functions like dump()
The current 55% coverage suggests that while we have good basic functionality testing, we're missing tests for the more complex, real-world usage scenarios that involve knowledge extraction, complex data structures, and full conversation processing workflows.

(ACTUALLY it's 64%, still low)
