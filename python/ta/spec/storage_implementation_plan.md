# SQLite Storage Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for migrating from in-memory storage to SQLite-based storage with persistent indexes. The implementation will be done in phases to minimize disruption and ensure thorough testing.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Schema Creation
1. Create new SQLite schema with all tables and indexes
2. Update existing SQLite storage to support new schema
3. Implement conversation metadata management

### Phase 2: Interface Updates
1. Update `IStorageProvider` with new index creation methods
2. Add conversation metadata management methods
3. Update existing interfaces to support new functionality

### Phase 3: Index Implementation
1. Implement SQLite-backed term-to-semantic-ref index
2. Implement SQLite-backed property index  
3. Implement SQLite-backed timestamp index
4. Update existing index usage to work with new implementations

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. Update conversation classes to use new indexes
2. Modify search and query logic to work with SQLite indexes
3. Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
4. Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 5: Lazy Loading (Final Phase)
1. Update Message interface to support chunk URIs
2. Implement lazy chunk loading in SqliteMessageCollection
3. Add chunk URI support to extractors
4. Test chunk loading performance and caching

## Migration Considerations

### Initial Implementation Strategy
- Use only the `chunks` field for storing message content initially
- Set `chunk_uri` to NULL for all messages during initial phases
- Implement lazy loading (chunk URIs) as the final phase after core functionality is stable

### Schema Versioning
- Store schema version in ConversationMetadata table
- Support migration between schema versions for future updates
- Fail gracefully on unsupported versions
- Provide upgrade paths for future schema changes

### Backward Compatibility
- Keep existing MemoryStorageProvider for testing and comparison
- Maintain existing API signatures where possible
- Deprecate rather than remove old interfaces
- Provide clear migration guides for future data

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategy
- Index all foreign key relationships for referential integrity
- Index commonly queried fields (timestamps, terms, properties)
- Consider compound indexes for complex query patterns
- Monitor index usage and optimize based on query patterns

### Transaction Management
- Use transactions for batch operations to ensure atomicity
- Implement proper rollback on failures
- Consider WAL mode for better concurrency
- Optimize transaction boundaries for performance

### Memory Management
- Implement chunk caching with LRU eviction
- Lazy load chunks only when needed
- Consider memory limits for large conversations
- Monitor memory usage and implement cleanup strategies

### Query Optimization
- Use prepared statements for common queries
- Implement connection pooling for concurrent access
- Add query optimization for common search patterns
- Consider read replicas for query-heavy workloads
- Profile and optimize slow queries

## Error Handling

### Database Errors
- Handle connection failures gracefully with retry logic
- Implement retry logic for transient errors
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Handle database corruption scenarios

### Data Integrity
- Use foreign key constraints to maintain relationships
- Implement proper validation before data insertion
- Handle constraint violations appropriately
- Provide data repair mechanisms for corrupted data

### Migration Errors
- Handle schema creation failures gracefully
- Provide rollback capabilities for failed schema updates
- Log detailed error information during setup
- Validate schema integrity after creation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test all new storage provider methods
- Test constraint enforcement and error handling
- Test lazy loading functionality
- Test migration utilities

### Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end workflows with new storage
- Test performance with realistic data sizes
- Test concurrent access scenarios
- Test schema creation and initialization

### Performance Tests
- Benchmark query performance vs in-memory storage
- Test with large datasets
- Profile memory usage patterns
- Test concurrent access performance

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Phase
- Implement alongside existing storage provider
- Use feature flags to switch between implementations
- Test thoroughly in development environment

### Staging Phase
- Deploy to staging environment
- Test with realistic data loads
- Performance testing with production-like scenarios

### Production Phase
- Gradual rollout with monitoring
- Rollback plan if issues are discovered
- Monitor performance and error rates
- Collect user feedback

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Degradation
- Performance monitoring during rollout
- Fallback to in-memory storage if needed
- Query optimization based on real usage patterns

### Compatibility Issues
- Maintain parallel implementations during transition
- Comprehensive testing of existing functionality
- Clear communication about breaking changes

## Success Criteria

### Functional
- All existing functionality works with new storage
- New features (chunk URIs, persistent indexes) work correctly
- Schema creation and initialization work properly

### Performance
- Query performance equal to or better than in-memory storage
- Memory usage reduced for large conversations
- Startup time not significantly impacted

### Reliability
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Stable operation under concurrent access
- Schema integrity maintained
