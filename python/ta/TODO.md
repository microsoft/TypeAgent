# TODO for the Python knowpro port

## Big functionality

    ### Serialization and deserialization
    Do this before queries, since fully re-indexing takes too long.

    - Serialization nearly done (gotta check TODO comments)
    - All of deserialization is still TODO

    ### Queries and searches

    So we can finally do some end-to-end testing.

    ### Retries for embeddings

    For robustness -- TypeChat already retries, but embeddings don't.

---

## Small functionality

- Implement Podcast._build_caches(), by implementing TermEmbeddingCache?
  - Umesh wants to redo this anyway, so low priority

## Refactoring implementations

- Change some inconsistent module names
- Rewrite podcast parsing without regexes

## Main/demo/test program support

- Unify various dotenv calls and make them search harder (relative to repo)

## Type checking stuff

- fuzzy_index type mismatch (could VectorBase be made to match the type?)
- Fix need for `# type: ignore` comments (usually need to make some I-interface generic in actual message/index/etc.)

## Low priority

- Tombstones for deletions.

## Maybe...

- Add docstrings etc.

## Questions

- Do the serialization data formats (which are TypedDicts, not Protocols):
  - Really belong in interfaces.py?
  - Need to have names starting with 'I'?
  My answers for both are no, unless Steve explains why.
