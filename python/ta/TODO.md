# TODO for the Python knowpro port

## Serialization and deserialization (basically done)

Do this before queries, since fully re-indexing takes too long.

- Serialization appears done (gotta check TODO comments)
- Deserialization ditto

### Still TODO:

- Remove a bunch of `XxxData` TypedDicts that can be dealt with using
  `deserialize_object` and `serialize_object`
- Catch and report DeserializationError better

## Queries and searches

STARTING THIS NOW.

So we can finally do some end-to-end testing.

## Retries for embeddings

For robustness -- TypeChat already retries, but my embeddings don't.

## Small functionality

- Implement Podcast._build_caches(), by implementing TermEmbeddingCache?
  - Umesh wants to redo this anyway, so low priority

## Refactoring implementations

- Change some inconsistent module names
- Rewrite podcast parsing without regexes

## Main/demo/test program support

- Unify various dotenv calls and make them search harder (relative to repo)

## Type checking stuff

- fuzzy_index type mismatch (could VectorBase be made to match the type?)
- Fix need for `# type: ignore` comments (usually need to make some I-interface generic in actual message/index/etc.)

## Low priority

- Tombstones for deletions.

## Maybe...

- Add docstrings etc.

## Questions

- Do the serialization data formats (which are TypedDicts, not Protocols):
  - Really belong in interfaces.py?
  - Need to have names starting with 'I'?
  My answers for both are no, unless Steve explains why.
