# TODO for the Python knowpro port

## General: Look for things marked as incomplete in source

- `TODO` comments
- `raise NotImplementedError` with TODO in arg or comment

### Cleanup:

- Remove a bunch of `XxxData` TypedDicts that can be dealt with using
  `deserialize_object` and `serialize_object`
- Catch and report `DeserializationError` better
- Sort out why `IConversation` needs two generic parameters;
  especially `TTermToSemanticRefIndex` is annoying. Can we do better?
- Unify or align or refactor `VectorBase` and `EmbeddingIndex`.

## Tighter types

- Several places allow `None` and in that case construct a default instance.
  It's probably better to either disallow `None` or skip that functionality.

## Queries and searches

Let me first describe the architecture.
We have several stages (someof which loop):

1. Parse natural language into a `SearchQuery`. (_searchlang.py_)
2. Transform this to a `SearchQueryExpr`. (_search.py_)
3. In `search_conversation`:
   a. compile to `GroupSearchResultsExpr` and run that query.
   b. compile to `IQueryOpExpr` and run that query.
   c. Combine the results into a `ConversationSearchResult`.
4. Turn the results into human language.

All of these stages are at least partially implemented,
so we have some end-to-end functionality.

The TODO items include:

- Move out of `demo` into `knowpro` what blongs there.
- Complete the implementation of each stage (b is missing a lot).
- Combine multiple human answers into a single "best" one.
- Split large contexts to avoid overflowing the answer generator's
  context buffer.
- Fix all the TODOs left in the code.
- Redesign the whole pipeline now that I understand the archtecture better.

# Older TODO action items

## Retries for embeddings

For robustness -- TypeChat already retries, but my embeddings don't.

## Refactoring implementations

- Change some inconsistent module names  [DONE -- if we are okay deviating from the TS module names]
- Rewrite podcast parsing without regexes (low priority)
- Switch from Protocol to ABC

## Type checking stuff

- fuzzy_index type mismatch (could VectorBase be made to match the type?)
- Fix need for `# type: ignore` comments (usually need to make some I-interface generic in actual message/index/etc.)

## Projct layout

- Move typeagent into src and associated changes everywhere
- Move test to tests
- Configure testpaths in pyproject.toml

## Testing

- Review Copilot-generated tests for sanity and minimal mocking
- Add new tests for newly added classes/methods/functions

## Deletions

- Tombstones for message and semantic ref deletions.
- Support other deletions.

## Questions

- Do the serialization data formats (which are TypedDicts, not Protocols):
  - Really belong in interfaces.py? [UMESH: No] [me: TODO]
  - Need to have names starting with 'I'? [UMESH: No] [me: DONE] [TS hasn't changed yet]
  My answers for both are no, unless Steve explains why.
